[{"content":"Jamelle Bouie posted on BlueSky about issue polling being the worst thing that has happened to progressives. When Jamelle posts something, a lot of people inevitably get mad, so I’m not sure if the post is still up. But he followed it up with the idea that progressives look at issue polls, see that people generally agree with them on a given poll, and commit to mobilization strategy rather than persuasion and coalition building.\nI had a beer the other day with a friend who worked on a major progressive election campaign. They did an internal poll on upzoning to drive affordability. It was incredibly unpopular, and the policy was ditched.\nThese two things are clearly two sides of the same coin. Jamelle is right that it’s toxic to progressives. But I think it’s more than that. It’s toxic to the entire body politic.\nPolitical polling is a pretty new thing, really only coming into its own pre-WW2, and even then, it was a mess. Early methods were based on market research, where organizations like reader’s digest would collect massive amounts of responses and extrapolate those to the general population. Then Gallup came in with statistical modelling, which was a new innovation in market research. The models aimed to collect a representative sample of potential voters rather than a large sample, and it was way more accurate. There have been a bunch of improvements to the polling process, and Gallup themselves have messed up a number of times, but on the whole, the system still kinda works. Polling firms get a representative sample - usually around 1000 people, which should give an acceptably low margin of error vs price of conducting the poll, and ask a simple binary choice - Republican or Democrat. Here in Canada and other multi-party democracies the math is slightly different, but the method is exactly the same.\nWhat doesn’t seem to work as well is issue polling. In issue polling, pollsters will usually ask three types of questions:\nissue identification potential solutions desired results That’s obviously a whole different kettle of fish than binary choices. Questions about binary choices - should I vote democrat or republican, say - contain within them whole hosts of qualitative information like issue prioritization, what solutions to issues might be, what results might come of those. But the question itself is about capability and intention as a voter. A voter may follow closely or not at all, but it’s a field in which essentially everyone has the same capabilities. Some people are political professionals, but every voter is as good at voting as everyone else.\nIssue polling, on the other hand, has enormously different inputs. It’s why marketing and research need to exist - people have different levels of interest, expertise, and skin in the game for all the issues that politics might touch. Subtle changes in wording can massively change people’s opinions on a subject. Changing a questionnaire from “do you intend to vote for a Republican or a Democrat?” likely won’t have a much different result from “would you rather a Republican or Democrat win the election?”. Changing a question from “do you think your city needs more apartments?” is going to have a massively different result from “do you think there should be more apartments near your house?”.\nThis was seen in the United States with questions around Medicare for All. Questions broadly phrased as “do you support Medicare for All” have enormous political support. But that doesn’t really mean anything. Medicare is a currently existing program that the people who use usually like. Medicare for All is a branding about getting rid of the current healthcare system and replacing it with a single government payer, like in Canada. Every question that was more specific polled worse the more specific it got - would you be okay with raising taxes to pay for it, would you be okay with potentially increased wait times, would you be okay with people in the insurance industry losing their jobs, would you be okay with losing your current service provider, etc.\nNone of that is meant to denigrate Medicare for All as an idea. Even a pretty sloppy implementation would probably be better in a lot of ways than the current American system, which has a whole bunch of people uninsured, a bunch of people underinsured, tons of people with awful copays and premiums, and oodles of bureaucracy and administrative spending. But people aren’t experts on that, and they have things they like about their current situation. Union members and professionals in America often have health care plans that are the envy of the world, with broad and deep coverage for a range of health adjacent services. They clearly wouldn’t want to lose that and go on basic Medicare, and that fear would be reflected in the polls, which can’t contain every contingency.\nBut there was a candidate who ran mostly on Medicare for All, and he was pretty damn popular. He almost got the nomination in 2016 for the party that ended up winning the popular vote, and he won several major states and was a frontrunner in 2020 for the party that won the popular vote and eventually the election. While campaigning on the issue opened him up to some attacks, it’s tough to say it hurt him, considering he was an underperforming senator from a very small state who almost became the president.\nIssue polling fails because it limits political imagination. Bernie identified healthcare as a problem facing voters in 2016 and 2020. He took a swing on a solution that was popular in the abstract, but extremely unpopular in the details. But he didn’t run on the details, and people didn’t fault him for it. The position definitely opened him up to attacks, and because he made improving medical coverage in the US table stakes, now there are clips of candidate Kamala Harris saying she’d like to ban private insurance. That’s not great for her, and a large amount of clips like that can add up in people’s perception, but again, it’s far from destructive. Because a voter answering extremely specific policy questions on the phone and checking a box in a voting booth are fundamentally different things.\nSame thing with upzoning, or other similar policies. Clearly this campaign recognized people prioritized the housing crisis. When asked by a polling firm on the phone if they support upzoning the whole city, they probably think that means there’ll be a 30 story tower built right next to their house. That would happen to vanishingly few people, probably about the same amount as it happens to now. But even raising that question, and getting that bad answer, makes politicians take viable solutions out of contention before they’re even on the table. And that’s a huge problem.\n","permalink":"https://sanspulp.github.io/posts/polling/","summary":"Jamelle Bouie posted on BlueSky about issue polling being the worst thing that has happened to progressives.

Edward argued that the NDP can’t be seen as a left-wing or socialist party, because in 2013 they removed the word socialism from their constitution. Arguments like these often end up stating that the NPD are a centre-left party, and the liberals are centre or centre-right, with the tories occupying the centre-right to far-right, and that Canada doesn’t have a left-wing party.\nBoth posters make valid arguments, and they make them thoughtfully. But they both raise a huge question for me, one that I ask myself every time I bellyache about politics with my friends and family, or attend local riding meetings.\nWhat is a left wing party? What does it mean to be left wing?\nThe origin of left and right wing comes from the French revolution, when the commoners in the French parliament sat on the left and the aristocrats sat on the right. The idea is that these representatives would vote in their own class interests, and “left-wing” carried through time and place to mean whig, liberal, populist, socialist, progressive, social democratic, labour, green, communist, and other parties, while “right-wing” would represent monarchist, conservative, reactionary, fascist, nationalist, and other political typologies. The idea of centrism comes only a little later, with some progressive aristocrats or moderate commoners (often, it is to be said, richer commoners) trying to broker between sides or serve their own interests.\nThe idea that these distinctions exist through time is a little ludicrous - while some members of the NDP may have read and enjoyed Rousseau and Thomas Paine and other “left-wing” thinkers of the 18th century, one would struggle to meaningfully link the British Labour party with the Whigs or the Dutch Green-Left with the American Populist Party. People simply don’t care about corn laws or silver coinage in the way they used to. Modern political considerations - climate change, LGBTQ rights, abortion, gun control, whatever, they don’t map cleanly onto old political parties. Imagine Medicare for All in a world where doctors still talk about bloodletting and balancing of humours. The defence is that it’s a useful shorthand or heuristic, and if you say left or right-wing, people know what you mean.\nBut do they? Really, do they?\nLooking at the two examples, David’s argument is that left-wing parties are defined by their actions. The Liberal Party of Canada are in government (supported officially, until recently, by the NDP), and they are openly taking actions that are anti-union and anti-worker. Unions and the working class are the constituent parts of the left, and by openly attacking those constituents, a party can’t meaningfully call itself left-wing.\nThat argument is mostly solid, and I’d be lying if I said that David explicitly stated “this is my argument and it’s ironclad”. It’s a post, it’s not a doctoral thesis. (His book, Too Dumb for Democracy, I believe was his thesis, and it’s good.) But a results based typology of leftism would crumble if applied over time. Does a left-wing political party need to cater to every request of a union in every situation? And if they fail to do so, due to budgetary pressures or electoral concerns or something else, do they lose their status as a left-wing party for eternity? Listening to workers is clearly an important litmus test for a party that claims to represent the working class, but if it’s applied broadly, I’m not sure there has never been a working class party in power. The Russian Social Democratic Workers Party clearly betrayed the working class many times. NDP Toronto Mayor David Miller was tarred as an out of control leftist, but he was hard on public sector workers during the 2009 garbage strike. Various Nordic Social Democratic parties have issued wage restraint during recessions. At some point, even in putatively socialist countries (what that word means is very contentious), political parties engage in brokerage, issue prioritization, and strategic thinking, some of which will inevitably run afoul of priorities from some unions or working class groups.\nEdward’s argument, insofar as I remember it, was about stated ideology. He brought up that Mulcair led a charge to remove the word “socialist” from the NDP’s constitution in 2013, and a party that does that certainly can’t be thought of as socialist, and publicly abandoning one of the major left-wing currents of thought means you’re probably not a left-wing party.\nThis argument also has really strong backing. Mulcair inherited a party that had been moderating since the signing of the Regina manifesto - first from the Winnipeg declaration and the merging with CLC and the fight against Hazen Argue’s more right-wing faction, then kicking out Waffle members in the 70s, to some centrist NDP provincial governments in the 90s and 00s. And Mulcair’s platform to remove socialist from the party constitution rhymed with Tony Blair’s removal of article IV from the UK Labour constitution, which was a signal of moving the party rightward. There are similar public statements in the US with the creation of the Democratic Leadership Council, or the incredibly confusing political currents in Eurocommunism, in which left-wing parties rebuked the Soviet Union and renounced some of their previous beliefs.\nBut trying to say that party statements matter that much is, again, not a durable concept. Once again, I’m not attacking Edward here - he’s a smart guy, and I’m trying to tease an understanding from a post where he was (rightly) saying that fascism and communism are different political currents. But I ask myself, were the NDP a socialist party up to the moment where Mulcair removed the word socialist from the constitution? Of course not. While some leaders like Jack Layton called themselves socialist, Jack also publicly called himself a moderate, talked about balanced budgets, and tried to get the party to focus on small, kitchen table issues rather than the workers controlling the means of production.\nAnd that argument also raises questions about language. Language politics are incredibly annoying, because people who believe the same or similar things will argue over semantics. This gets raised all the time in international politics, where the American word “liberal” and the European word “liberal” mean very different things - the American word refers to left-wingers who support a large government and welfare state, the European word refers to right-wingers who support small government, private property, and markets. And then there’s the Canadian Liberals, who refer to a political party that supports both of those things and neither of those things, depending on which way the wind is blowing.\nBut there’s also weird language about socialism and commitment to leftism because, well, some countries just never used the word socialist that often. Marx used the word socialist and communist interchangeably, and it wasn’t until later left wing thinkers that “socialism” became associated with an interim stage before “communism” was defined as the final stage, the classless society. But a lot of parties that were putatively Marxist called themselves “social democratic” parties - that’s really a linguistic difference between Slavic/Germanic languages and romantic languages. A purely linguistic typology gets confused, when the Swedish social democrats were, for most of their history, to the left of the French Socialists. And don’t forget, the communists in Russia? They were social democrats. So Mulcair removing the word socialist and committing the NDP to social democracy, if you want to be funny, could be said to be in the tradition of Vladimir Lenin.\nUltimately, what is a left-wing party? I think it’s about public perception. Vibes, if I’m flippant. The NDP are Canada’s left-wing party because the Canadian public views them as left-wing. The Liberals are the centre, the conservatives are the right. How close or far these parties are to one another shifts and changes over time, and sometimes they may totally flip - like Ontario in the 70s, where the PCs were seen as left of the Liberals, or federally in 2015, when the NDP were seen as right of the Liberals. But in a democracy, I don’t think it’s useful or possible to define left, centre, and right entirely through actions taken when in power, or through statements made in elections and public documents. Those two things are indicative, and influence public perception, but ultimately the voters decide.\nVoters are fickle, political discourse is dominated by media conglomerates, and polities change as a result. Political parties may cynically chase votes, attempt to change their public perception, even abandon voting groups, but for the most part they try and maximize their vote share, and thus, most of a given polity is served in a given election. The parties are what the people say there are.\nNow, to be clear about two things:\nThere are absolutely voters who are ignored, and there are political systems that ensure better representation of the full polity, like proportional representation. But if Canada had proportional representation starting today, there wouldn’t be a party to the left of the NDP that got 30% or even 10% of the vote. Left-wing Canadians vote for the NDP, because we understand them as the most left-wing party, and when there’s a leadership election, we try and get the left-wing Candidate to win. I know, I tried to get Niki Ashton to win in 2017, and she didn’t. Those of us who are left-wing either come back to the fold, like I shamefully do every time, or abandon electoral politics or vote communist. But considering how many people vote for the communist party, it doesn’t seem like there are that many Canadians who consider the NDP insufficiently left wing.\nThat doesn’t mean the NDP are as good at winning elections as they could be, or that they’re a good party! Maybe there are some additional votes to be gotten by calling themselves socialist again, as Canadians have fairly positive feelings about the word socialism. Maybe NDP mayors and premiers being insufficiently anti-worker hurts them. But Jagmeet ran pretty far to the left of Mulcair or Layton in his rhetoric in 2019, and got the lowest share of the popular vote for the NDP since 2004 for his efforts (Singh’s 2021 run just edged out Layton’s 2006 run). Ed Broadbent had a couple really good runs, and polled in first place for a little while while calling himself a socialist. But he also kicked out the Waffle members, who were clearly to his left. So left wing and the NDP, it’s a moving target, as it is with every political party.\nWhat does it mean to be left-wing? In Canada, it probably means you identify as a socialist, and if you do that, you probably vote for the NDP. But hell, maybe you vote Liberal! There are lots of Liberals who call themselves socialists, and the fact that the NDP have never formed federal government - only parties who call themselves liberal or conservative have - means many Canadians see the Liberals as the country’s left-wing party of government. And that view isn’t entirely wrong. Tony Benn of UK Labour used to say “Labour is not a socialist party, but there are socialists in it”, and there are socialists and social-democrats in the Liberal Party of Canada. One of them is currently the environment minister, at least as far as he self identifies. If you’re really left-wing, you probably still vote for the NDP, but you dislike them a lot of the time. You might miss Jack Layton a lot, who ran to the right of the current NDP leader, but at least one time he got a ton of votes from Quebec.\nAll this ties into a great question - is it electorally beneficial to be left wing? Is the Canadian public aching for a “real” left wing party? That’s a point that gets raised a lot during electoral political discussions, and I think I’ll write about that next.\n","permalink":"https://sanspulp.github.io/posts/secondpost/","summary":"I’ve been reading some posts by David Moscrop, who I greatly admire, as well as Edward Row, who I also really like, discussing who exactly is left and right in Canadian electoral politics.\nDavid argues that the Liberal Party of Canada can’t be meaningfully seen as left-wing, with his examples forcing railroad workers to arbitration and demanding public servants go back to work.

Pretextual planning is fairly self explanatory - a city (or other level of government, or maybe a private business or NGO) creates a plan, and elements of that plan are a pretext for doing something else.\nThe strong towns argument brings up parking requirements, which are a horrible policy idea that forces developers to build expensive parking, despite small and midsized cities having a massive parking surplus, and large cities trying to redevelop parking into higher order uses like housing, public amenities, and employment sites. Planners use parking minimums as a pretext for getting concessions from developers. When I worked as a planning advisor, the parking minimums in downtown Toronto (which have since been eliminated - except for in rooming houses, which is completely pretextual to ban rooming houses) were egregious, and no planner enforced them. Rather, they used them as a bargaining chip to get more community benefits, or a donation towards something like a Bike Share station.\nThis was unaccountable and in my opinion undermines public trust, but it’s also pretty small beans. The bike share station might have been something like half a million dollars. That’s three downtown parking spots, maybe. Any developer would be happy to make that trade to lose a 50 spot requirement. It’s unprincipled, but again, small beans.\nThe problem is that small beans add up. Big developers can afford the lawyers and planners to get around them, but that ultimately raises the prices of homes by both diluting the supply (small builders can’t enter the market) and by increasing soft costs like legal fees. And there’s pretext everywhere in society, especially in public administration, and it creates layers of uncertainty that drives up costs and decreases transparency and public accountability. It’s obvious in municipal planning documents because a) they’re public documents, and b) they’re openly contradictory.\nI think this is most clearly seen in Toronto’s building heights.\nThere’s a ton of planning documents that builders have to go through, but the main pieces are the official plan and the zoning bylaw(s). The official plan speaks at a high level to the type of buildings and communities that the city wants to see. It’s the guiding document for council’s land use strategy. If council were a business, this would be the business plan that they’d present to banks and lenders, would be the public facing “about us” page, and would inform all communications sent to customers. The zoning bylaw is the equivalent of regulations and standard operating procedures - heights, lot sizes, units per lot, distance from the street, etc.\nYou would think, if you wanted to design good bylaws, you could have them facilitate the objectives in your plan. If you were running a business that was creating a new email service, and your business plan said “our emails send with less than 1 second delay”, an internal control that delayed each email send by say, 6 hours, would be absolutely ludicrous. You may wish to have controls for certain reasons - say, emails that seem confidential are delayed by some period of time, or emails that are written in a rage, or something along those lines. Your regulations or standard operating procedures would be written to facilitate the desired outcome, with controls for exceptions and potential problems.\nToronto has decided to do it backwards. The city’s official plan speaks to neighbourhoods, which are the largest single land use in Toronto. In the plan’s definition, a neighbourhood “is made up of residential uses in lower scale buildings such as detached houses, semi-detached houses, duplexes, triplexes and townhouses, as well as interspersed walk-up apartments that are no higher than four storeys”. A further item mentions “four storeys or less”. One would think that the neighbourhood designation in the zoning bylaw, more or less, allows for four storeys.\nBut that’s not the case. Toronto’s City Council recently went through a large scale review of the zoning code to allow for duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in neighbourhoods, where they were previously banned (despite, again, clearly being referenced in the definition). The planning department then went through the neighbourhood height overlay map, which is a separate zoning bylaw that speaks to building heights allowed as of right.\nThe resulting recommendations - where heights were less than 10m, allow up to 10m. Where heights were between 10-12m, allow 12m. In imperial units, that’s about 32’10” or 39’4”.\nThe problem is that 12m/39’4” is too short. A standard residential storey is 9 feet of living space plus 1 foot of mechanical between stories. If your building starts absolutely at grade, you’re building 40 feet, and that’s before thinking about the pitch of the roof, which in a potentially snowy city like Toronto is important.\nSo despite an official plan that says 4 storeys are allowed in neighbourhoods, and a years long compliance exercise to allow 4 unit buildings that are potentially 4 storeys, there are 0 neighbourhoods where a normal 4 storey building is allowed as-of-right.\nThis seems like small beans, right? If you’re allowed to build 39’4” and your proposed building is 40’, surely there must be a way to get that rule slightly bent. And there is. The city has something called The Committee of Adjustment, which allows for variances to the zoning bylaw. All you need to do is pay thousands of dollars for your committee application, pay for a planning deputation by an accredited planner, wait the 3-6 months for your committee appointment while paying any costs on the land, and survive potentially hundreds of letters of objection from local busybodies. Then you might get approval from a committee of unaccountable and unelected adjudicators, and you can build a type of building the city says that it wants and that it allows.\nClearly this is absurd. No one starting from first principles would design a system like this. No one starting a private business would make their business operate like this. And this is the type of governmental policy that makes normal people into libertarians - the idea that thousands of little items in government policy are poorly thought out, or are very well thought out to benefit certain groups - in this case, NIMBYs, but in other cases, interest groups or whatever other shadowy group may exist.\nGood government reformers should be obsessed with cleaning up existing problems like this, and public servants should have a culture that makes their recommendations textual, not pretextual. If politicians want to muddle with recommendations, fine. They’re elected, they’re accountable for their actions. But when planning staff came forward with a recommendation to allow four storeys, and a zoning bylaw that banned four storeys, that was an exercise in cynicism, and should be seen as such.\n","permalink":"https://sanspulp.github.io/posts/mypost/","summary":"Sean Galbraith and Strong Towns have both talked about pretextual planning.
