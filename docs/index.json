[{"content":"I can’t afford a decent place in Toronto. It\u0026rsquo;s a shitty situation, and it’s something I think about all the time. My bathroom is covered in mold, my kitchen has mice and roaches, and our old windows leak cold air in the summer and warm air in the winter. And I’m a well paid public servant living in a rent controlled apartment! Things could be ten times worse. It’s abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that housing prices have become divorced from incomes in Toronto, and across Canada, and people have all sorts of explanations.\nOn that note, Councillor Gord Perks of Ward 4 (Parkdale-High Park) in Toronto recently made some claims about Toronto’s housing crisis, which was followed up by a piece in Storeys, one of Toronto’s development/real estate verticals.\nAs the chair of the planning and housing committee at Toronto City Hall and one of the longest standing progressives at City Council, his remarks are important, because they reflect a view among progressive Torontonians about the roots of the housing crisis and solutions to it. His comments also made a lot of people in the broad Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) coalition upset, and I think for good reason.\nI want to analyze his remarks, and suggest some changes to his analysis of the current state of affairs in Toronto. Sorry this piece is so long. A better writer would split it into multiple posts, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a better writer.\nBackground/Why am I doing this? Councillor Gord Perks took over the planning and housing committee from Brad Bradford after the resignation of John Tory and subsequent election of Olivia Chow as mayor. It’s clearly a coveted position for him, with Gord publicly weighing in on Toronto planning policy for years in the media and online. To some, Gord represents a break from Brad Bradford and his predecessor Ana Bailao tenures as chair, moving the ideological and practical centre of the committee away from a market/YIMBY view of housing to a social/NIMBY view of housing. I think this view is massively overstated for a couple reasons. Firstly, conservative mayors continually stuck progressives on the planning committee (along with public health and a couple other less prestigious committees) in an effort to defang them, and take them away from committees like the budget committee. While Brad and Ana were friends of those conservative mayors, they were in the left part of those mayoral coalitions. Secondly, Gord, Ana, and Brad vote or voted together on almost every social and market reform that came before council. Brad’s mayoral run and voting record since the election of Olivia Chow aside, the degree of ideological difference between Toronto-East York councillors - where Brad, Ana, and Gord work - is much smaller than the difference between T-EY councillors and councillors from the inner suburbs, which are often vastly more reform minded than councillors from the outer suburbs. But this shift is frustrating to groups like More Neighbours Toronto, HousingNOW Toronto, and other volunteer or business interests that are counted in the YIMBY coalition.\nTo be frank, I count myself as broadly sympathetic to that coalition, placing myself on its left fringe (Read The Affordable City). I think the basic statement that housing prices are a result of low supply, and that low supply is partly driven by lengthy, uncertain, and byzantine processes to be at least part of the explanation for the housing crisis.1\nI’m writing this because I think Gord is an intelligent guy, and is open to having his mind changed if presented with a compelling argument supported by facts. Research about changing people’s minds supports the idea that most people are open to having their minds changed, even on deeply held beliefs, unless people are rude to them. While groups like More Neighbours generally approach Toronto politicians with a more positive or conciliatory tone, there’s no shortage of actors in the housing space who think you catch more flies with vinegar. It’s frustrating having to be nice to powerful people you believe to be wrong, but it’s not supported by data that being negative works, and it’s frankly damaging to the human soul to be angry all the time. The other democratic way of changing Gord’s mind, or effectively doing so, is electing someone else as the member of council for Ward 4. However, it’s not clear to me that Chemi Lhamo or Siri Agrell, the two runners up in 2022, were more supportive of a broadly YIMBY agenda than Gord, so I think debating with Gord is the best path for the moment.\nWho am I to do this? Well, no one really. I’m not an elected official, though I did work as a planning advisor to Joe Cressy, Gord’s friend and colleague on city council. I’m not a planner or a land economist, but then again, neither is Gord, so I’m disagreeing with him as an equal when it comes to credentials. Instead, I’m relying on the work of planners, economists, advocates, architects, and builders as I go through his claims item by item.\nWhat is Gord’s argument? I don’t want to misrepresent Gord’s argument, so most of what I talk about here will be in response to direct quotes and summaries of quotes from the Storey’s article.\nAbout zoning and city processes, Gord dismissed arguments that zoning by-laws, fees and fines, and a\u0026quot;robust\u0026quot; public consultation process are barriers to housing, calling the claims \u0026ldquo;utterly, utterly false.\u0026rdquo;\nAbout the interaction between the city/government and the market, Gord claims that Government action is not why there’s a housing affordability crisis in Toronto and that Toronto\u0026rsquo;s development industry that has limited the creation of the type of housing the City needs\nAbout the recency of the housing crisis, Gord claims that \u0026ldquo;Prior to 2010, there was a reliable relationship between people’s incomes and rent and mortgage cost. In order for the argument that zoning and fees are the problem to make sense, something would have had to happen in zoning and fees sometime 10 to 15 years ago, that suddenly changed the relationship, and nothing happened.\u0026rdquo;\nAbout the reach of these problems, Gord claims “Firstly, It’s not a local problem. This is a global problem. Every major urban area we have any information about is going through an affordability crisis,\u0026quot; Perks tells STOREYS. The problem, summarized by Perks, is one of income inequality and wealth distribution on a global scale.\nNarrowing down on that question of reach about the issue being with capitalism and income inequality, Gord claims \u0026ldquo;Probably about three quarters of all wealth in the world right now is tied up in real estate.” That money is “accumulating with the wealthy, and instead of building factories they\u0026rsquo;re buying land, so the price of land has skyrocketed.\u0026rdquo;\nAbout the difference between eras in market housing, Gord claims \u0026ldquo;In 1970 or so, a developer would build a building and own it, and they were in for a long haul,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;Now you have a whole class that is turning over land fast and then handing it over to a condominium corporation. So you have this quick return thing going on.\u0026rdquo; At the same time, he explains, a building won\u0026rsquo;t get constructed without pre-selling at least 70% of its units — the majority of which are bought by investors who then turn them into rentals or just sit on them forever.\nAbout the solution, Gord claims \u0026ldquo;So you have all these market things going on that are utterly outside of the ability of municipalities to do anything about,\u0026rdquo; Perks says. To him, the solution to this inherently capitalistic model is its inverse: social housing. \u0026ldquo;If you look around the world, historically, no one, ever, anywhere, has solved a housing affordability problem through the private market,\u0026rdquo; he says. Instead, he points to places like Vienna and Stockholm, where their governments have invested robustly in social housing.\nWhat are the theories of the housing crisis? I’m going to look at two main theories of the crisis - the one that Gord is arguing against, and the one he is broadly arguing for.\nThe theory that Gord broadly defines as “market urbanist” is a neoclassical economic theory. The main claim is that housing prices are determined by supply and demand, with the price being determined at the level where supply and demand curves meet. Housing supply is too low, which means that demand exceeds supply, raising the price. That’s illustrated by the following graph: S is the previous state of supply, S1 is the current state of supply. As the supply curve moves to the left - decreasing relative to demand - P shifts upward to P1.\nI’ll note that supply of apartments isn’t necessarily decreasing - apartments in Toronto are clearly being built!2 But supply is decreasing relative to demand. You could also say the demand curve is moving to the right, with increased immigration and smaller household formation requiring more units and other things, but what really matters is the argument that we’re not building enough housing to meet the demand.\nI’ve always found the supply/demand curve visually a little baffling, so here’s a simple example to illustrate the effect of the supply/demand curve. There’s a town with two families, and two houses. Both families are housed, but neither can move without displacing the other. Additionally, no one can move to this town. If you destroy one of the houses, now either one of the families is homeless, or the two families are overcrowded. If you add a third house instead of demolishing one of them, now the households can move between houses if their family situation changes - they have a kid or a family member moves in and they need a bigger house, or a family member dies or moves out and they want a smaller house - or a new family can move to town. And if you build a fourth house, now there’s enough supply that the households can haggle with the owners of the empty houses for cheaper rents or purchase prices.\nObviously this is a massive oversimplification of housing markets, but anyone who has been in a line up to rent an apartment knows that shortages cause price spikes and overcrowding, and people who lives in cities during April 2020 when people moved out of downtowns know large amounts of vacant apartments cause price drops for rents.\nThe argument then goes on to state that the reason for the supply shortage is, in part, due to process, fees, and consultation. In a capitalist society, housing developers need to be able to rent or sell properties at a certain price - in the private sector, maybe 15% above expected costs - in order to get the loans necessary to buy the land, pay the fees, and pay for parts and labour. If an increase in government fees, long delays in the permitting process (remember, developers are potentially paying mortgages and interest while going through the permitting process) and uncertainty on the approvals (a neighbourhood group demanding an 8 unit apartment have 4 apartments instead), the costs of developing the building are lower than the potential sale price of the building, and it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to be built. I say unlikely because sometimes the developer will estimate wrong, build the building anyway, and be forced to take a loss or a lower profit. The argument would then state that uncertainty of profit discourages people from developing their own homes or entering the market, meaning small and mid sized developers are frozen out, and large developers move slowly and cautiously. A company like Great Gulf, who build massive apartment towers, can afford to take a few losses here and there because they hedge their bets, but John with a Truck who wants to build a 4plex needs to know he’s going to turn a profit, or he goes bankrupt.\nThe socialist rebuttal to this is multifaceted. They might claim that publicly built housing is naturally going to be more affordable than privately built housing, because public builders don’t need the 15% profit margins, can finance with better rates due to government borrowing advantage, and can amortize the debts over longer periods. They might claim that fees on building - what we in Ontario call development charges, but are also called impact charges, housing charges, and other phrases - don’t raise the price of the building, but in fact lower the price of the land. The argument is that the land market is competitive, and high fees redound to the advantage of builders, who have more sophisticated estimates, more choice of where to build, and no carrying costs until they buy some land. There’s also arguments about financialization or speculation, where people who have no intention of building any apartments are participating in the real estate market, only wanting to hold onto some land and drive up the price, or get outsized returns from a small investment on the back of future renters.\nOne of the strongest arguments coming from socialists is that development is less a question of supply and demand than it is power and class. Without naming specific premiers who are under investigation by the RCMP, housing developers are massive donors to political parties, and pay for access and preferential legislation. Some of these developers are connected to the mob, some may run for fascist parties in Italy. Sure, some of these developers may be paying for an even playing field, rule of law based development, and the eventual low prices these changes will bring, but you don’t become the richest people in Ontario building simple commodities in competitive markets. And it’s not like any housing developers are innovators - they’re just building balloon frame houses with stick lumber and drywall, which North America has known how to build for 100 odd years, or concrete towers, which we’ve known how to build for 70 years. North American development is, partly, a cash for access game, where big landowners get rezonings and approvals and make much more than the 15% profit that’s necessary to secure a bank loan. They then launder these profits through donations to hospitals, museums, and other cultural institutions to preserve their image, and then donate other portions to think tanks and newspapers to support the political parties who will keep granting them these favourable rezonings.\nSo who is correct? They both are. And that’s not saying that the truth is somewhere in the middle - there’s no middle. Both sides are correct - the capitalists are correct in saying bad policies are creating a supply deficit, and that supply deficit is hurting renters and first time buyers. And the socialists are correct in saying horrible actors are exploiting those bad policies and supply deficit to extract enormous rents and profits, and that public housing is the way to create deeply affordable housing.\nI think that’s what my read of the data says, anyway.\nWhat is the data supporting these theories? That’s a little more difficult to measure. The “housing crisis” as it’s broadly defined - increased rent and purchase prices for tenants and first time buyers, smaller apartments for new entrants, overcrowding in existing apartments, renovictions, increase in homelessness - is relatively new, with most cities becoming markedly less affordable shortly after the global financial crisis. Certain cities have been having huge housing affordability issues for multiple decades now - San Francisco, one of the least affordable cities in America, saw its housing prices start to increase in the 90s, and Vancouver’s started outpacing wages shortly thereafter. But these crises are also cyclical. San Francisco was the home of Henry George, the 19th century economist who was already advocating against the high cost of living in the peninsula.\nThe data supporting the “market urbanist” approach is scattered, and is pretty new. Any substantial reforms to zoning, processes, building codes, etc., is very recent. The arguments mainly point to data from 5 jurisdictions - Tokyo, Houston, Austin, Minneapolis, and New Zealand.\nTokyo is the example of housing abundance over a long period of time, and simplified zoning codes. Over a period of years, spurred on by the housing crisis in Tokyo in the early 90s, the federal government vastly simplified the zoning codes across the country, and in doing so effectively allowed small apartments in every district of the country, as well as increasing heights, lot coverage, and a number of other zoning and code changes. The net effect has been a wild amount of housing units built in the country, especially in the big cities. Japan has some of the flattest housing prices in the developed world, has the average housing size increasing substantially over twenty years as opposed to decreasing like much of the west, and also supports small businesses in doing so - Japan has about ten times the architects per capita as the US, many of them building small apartments and homes. But Japan is a weird outlier - its national population peaked about fifteen years ago after decades of very slow growth, and has been falling since. Tokyo itself is growing, but the demand curve is different than other western countries, which are growing, and in Canada’s case, quickly.\nHouston is the example of no zoning, which is something market urbanists like Nolan Grey push for. As most of North America was adopting zoning codes to regulate neighbourhood development, the city of Houston demurred, having a series of consultations and referendums but never adopting a zoning code, opting instead for legal covenants in neighborhoods. Given neighbourhoods would vote to adopt certain restrictions on their land use, most of which was about average lot size in a neighbourhood, and a series of design related requirements on buildings that could be built on those lots. The result of this strange mix of regulations is that it’s pretty easy to build tall, skinny detached townhouses, which has resulted in a ton of detached townhouses in the inner suburbs of Houston, with relatively low prices for new, fairly luxurious housing, and some of the lowest housing prices to income ratios in the country. Houston also has a low homelessness ratio, despite being in a state with threadbare welfare programs. In a cheap city, the argument goes, getting someone into a housing unit doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost very much.\nAustin, Minneapolis, and New Zealand (mostly Auckland) are all examples of new YIMBY actions. All three have loosened regulations on new developments, and the net effect has been increased supply, and flat lining or falling rents over a period of years where neighbouring jurisdictions have seen massive rent spikes.\nThe problem with the data is that there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough jurisdictions who have taken a big swing with YIMBY policies over a long enough time period to see big results. In a statistics class you\u0026rsquo;d want to see 100 or so subject cities before you make any big claims, because local factors could have a much bigger influence on the results than something like zoning laws. YIMBYs have 5 jurisdictions that they can really point to, and that means their argument doesn’t have the robust, statistically significant effect that they (we) would like. But to the best of my knowledge, there are no jurisdictions that have made a big, meaningful process and zoning change, and ended up with more expensive housing as a result, so YIMBYism can’t be proven wrong by pointing to a negative.\nInstead, people like Gord point to Stockholm and Vienna to explain the socialist argument, and lots of socialists also point to Singapore. Stockholm has pretty significant investment in social housing, Vienna is even higher, and Singapore is much higher still. Data in Stockholm and Vienna is pretty messy in a word-for-word comparison - both these countries have a lot of “cooperative” housing, but European cooperatives are much different than Canadian cooperatives, the European ones being a unique form of market housing with rules and levels of affordability that vary by jurisdiction, while Canadian cooperatives are (mostly) deeply affordable publicly subsidized housing that’s run by the tenants rather than the government. Singapore goes further than the two European examples, with essentially all of the housing being built and managed by the government, with tenants owning 99 year leases on their apartments.\nIt’s pretty clear that residents in these cities pay less of their income than urban Canadians for what are broadly considered nicer apartments - at least, larger than our new housing units and in nicer condition than our old housing units. Canada’s massive suburban population with very large, mostly detached housing is tough to compare to areas where land is more scarce. That’s not nothing - having bigger, nicer apartments that cost less money and are more secure for their tenants is the whole ballgame. But what’s also clear is that there are big issues with Vienna, Stockholm, and Singapore. If Japan can’t be used as an argument in favour of capitalist housing production because their population has been stagnant for 30 years, Vienna still hasn’t recovered its pre WW1 population! Stockholm is growing much faster, but that’s placed enormous demands on the public housing, with wait lists growing averaging 10 years, with some residents waiting for 20 years. And Singapore is having many other issues - some of the 99 year leases are coming close to completion, which raises questions about what happens afterwards. Some incumbents are demanding the government build less housing, so the value of their leases goes up, which is…well, it’s instructive about Singaporian belief on supply and demand. And that’s not to mention the racial politics governing Singaporian housing allocation, which almost certainly would fall afoul of Canadian human rights laws.\nThere could be a “no true Scotsman” argument about how these aren’t socialist housing markets - Sweden is mostly a social democratic country, Austria is a conservative country with a social democratic city, and Singapore is an autocratic country with a nationalized housing board. But there’s a lot of people to house, and who knows when the revolution will come? So they’re probably the best examples.\nWhat does Gord get right? On the recency of the housing crisis, Gord is mainly correct. Toronto’s year over year returns in the early 2000s were frequently in the low single digits, around 3-4% per year, usually around or only slightly above GDP growth in the country at that time, which was hovering at around 2-3%. However, Vancouver’s was significantly higher, often 8-9% YoY returns in the early 00s, and housing returns are cumulative - house prices increasing by a percent or two above incomes every year quickly divorces housing costs from household incomes due to compounding interest. Added to that, increasing house prices can be seen as a leading indicator of a supply shortage - a vacancy rate slipping from 7% to 6% will be barely noticeable by tenants and purchasers, as there’s still a relatively large stock of available housing, the available stock only having decreased by 14%. but a rate slipping from 3% to 2% is a decrease of 33%, and the rate slipping from 2% to 1% is a decrease of 50%. For reference, Toronto’s current vacancy rate for purpose built apartments is 1.7%. Considering part of the argument is that the process delays housing, these leading indicators are really important. But his general claim, that housing went a little silly in 2010 and beyond (really accelerating in ~2016, and then again during the pandemic) is broadly true.\nAbout the reach of these problems, again Gord is mostly correct. ING finds the housing crisis expressed in different ways across Europe, with various countries having more crowing, longer stays in the parental homes, more people per bedroom, and house to income ratios. However, the FT points out that the crisis is worse in the Anglosphere than in the rest of the developed world, which leads one to believe that might have something to do with Anglo approaches to planning and property rights . Of note is that Ireland is among the worst cases in the FT analysis, but comes out massively ahead in the ING analysis. That’s maybe a result of the time series - Ireland had an extremely deep crisis following the 2008 recession/Euro crisis, so the starting point matters for the analysis, and also probably has something to do with difficulty comparing Irish data due to its status as a tax haven for American capital.\nAbout this being a result of income inequality, and speculation on land as opposed to investment in productive capacity, there’s probably something to this. There’s definitely a lot of land and real estate speculation on the market at any time. Left wing critics of this type of financial activity view it as a zero-sum activity, with end users ultimately paying the price for the inflated asset values, while right wing supporters of this view it as important for price discovery. I tend towards the left-wing criticism, but I’ll note that the thrust of the argument from small developers is “please make it easier for us to invest in productive capacity like building apartments”, and that it’s much easier to speculate on scarce assets - whether that’s developable land or apartments themselves - than on abundant assets.\nAnd on general inequality, it’s important to note that the much less egalitarian United States has more affordable housing than Canada, and that the worst housing crisis is in some of the most egalitarian areas - BC and Ontario are more egalitarian than Saskatchewan, which has more affordable housing, but all of them fall massively behind Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, and other southern and sunbelt states with threadbare welfare states. A huge part of the inequality is because of the housing problem. Below are maps of housing prices versus incomes in Canada and the United States, as well as the GINI coefficients of the provinces and states, which is a coefficient which measures inequality. There\u0026rsquo;s no observable correlation, and if anything, the less equal places have better housing affordability than the more equal places, which directly refutes Councillor Perks\u0026rsquo; argument.\nAbout social housing being the solution, I think Gord is directionally correct. Deeply affordable housing is almost never provided by the private sector, except in forms like tenements, favelas, and other substandard housing. Publicly subsidized housing is a form of redistribution and a key element of the welfare state for those who are nowhere near being able to afford market rate housing. However, there’s a kind of conflation in terms going on here. Gord claims that no one has ever solved housing affordability through the private market. If we take that to mean deeply affordable housing for the lowest income in society, Gord is correct - that is almost always provided by government, or heavily subsidized by government. However, if we take housing affordability as a metric of median incomes versus median house prices, that is almost always addressed through the private market. Even one of his examples - Stockholm - has a robust private market, with 80% of Swedes in some form of private housing (whether that’s purely private, cooperative, union owned, or non profit), while 20% live in public housing. Canada used to have more publicly built and subsidized housing, but it also used to build more private housing, and the ratio of public housing never exceeded 10% of the total stock.\nWhere do I think he could improve his analysis? On Democracy and Zoning - this is where I butt heads with Gord the most. He talks about. A reminder (which you probably need, because I can’t shut up about this and this article is now thousands of words long), Gord’ claim is that:\nThe argument that zoning by-laws, fees and fines, and a\u0026quot;robust\u0026quot; public consultation process are barriers to housing is \u0026ldquo;utterly, utterly false.\u0026rdquo; The implication - and to be clear, I don’t think this is something that Councillor Perks believes - is that there is no trade-off between local democracy/regulation/zoning and economic efficiency.\nOf course there is. I’m going to tackle zoning by-laws, fees, and fines first. There has to be a tradeoff between the legislation in our bylaws and what gets produced by the market. This is one of the first lessons learned in economics or sociology or essentially any type of science or social science. Delaying a building has the effect of the building being built later. Making the building shorter has the effect of the building not being as tall. That means, probably, either fewer units or fewer bedrooms. Making a building expensive to build for whatever reason - heritage protections, material choices, constant cutaways into the building\u0026rsquo;s shape - absolutely makes it more expensive to rent or buy in.\nTo illustrate this, I guess I’ll use an example that Councillor Perks will probably hate. In the 2016 Democratic Party primaries, Senator Clinton attacked Senator Sanders by saying “Bernie promises everyone a pony”. She was referring, I think, to his proposal for Medicare for All, a state run universal health care system.\nThat was a dumb attack on the merits, because universal health care is pretty popular and functional in most western democracies except the United States. But universal health care does come with trade-offs - rich people don’t have preferential access to medicine, doctors make less money, insurance claims adjusters and administrators will lose their jobs. Large numbers of American union members are concerned about Medicare for All plans, because generally union members get healthcare plans that are much better than what the government currently provides with Medicare/Medicaid, and would likely provide with a universal system. I would still loudly support Medicare for All, as I think the benefits vastly outweigh the costs. These universal health care systems exist across the world and are usually quite functional and popular. But if Bernie was saying that every resident of the United States could live in Windsor Castle, that would have been an “everyone deserves a pony” moment. Real estate development has very clear material and geographic/geometric tradeoffs. Windsor Castle is big and expensive! Building enough Windsor Castles for 300 million - or 8 billion, or whatever - people to live in would take a lot of resources and be a dumb promise. So working backwards from that, we can see that regulations on building shape and size, on process, on materials, on unit counts, on greenspace, on whatever else, have at least marginal tradeoffs.\nThis is, I think, something that many members of Toronto City Planning believe, and absolutely is believed by the housing secretariat, the city’s affordable housing coordinator, and by CreateTO, the city’s housing developer. Both of the latter divisions talk about accelerating public consultation, and have delivered reports to council on waiving fees, accelerating approvals, and in the case of deeply affordable housing, getting the provincial minister of housing to overrule the city’s zoning. It is listed in public reports that it’s essential to delivering housing affordably, and Councillor Perks votes for these staff recommendations. Retired Toronto City Planner Jennifer Keesmaat has been publicly criticizing restrictive zoning since the second she entered the private sector and tried to deliver affordable housing, as does former Senior Planner in the Chief Planner’s office Graig Uens, who recently had to defend a small development in University Rosedale through multiple rounds of committee hearings and appeals. Even the famously tight lipped former chief planner Gregg Lintern will subtly tweet about the necessity of as-of-right entitlements, gentle density, and expanding housing options.\nOn democracy, that’s a whole other kettle of fish. It’s tough to attack the idea that our society should be democratic. Democracy is pretty great! But it’s not clear to me that the city’s zoning bylaws, consultation practices, and housing production is in any way meaningfully democratic, or that attempts to increase the importance of these processes make the city more democratic.\nTo investigate this, I have two thoughts: one, that our processes are actually anti-democratic, and secondly, that our processes aren’t democracy as its normally considered, but instead formalized corruption.\nOn the first, that our processes are anti-democratic - well, I think this is pretty obvious when investigated. In survey after survey, “building more housing” is a popular stance, and “building more affordable housing” is much more popular. Political polling has its issues, and if you word questions about building affordable housing near the respondent it polls underwater, but politicians run on building housing, because people like having roofs over their heads and construction jobs pay well. Exceptionally few candidates run on “building less housing”, but then when they get into office, politicians do just that - create barriers to market housing, defund affordable housing, and create processes that delay and deny. So this is anti-democratic.\nBut it’s not just that. Democracy, in most people’s conceptualization, is a modernist practice. It’s about counting votes, and the most votes win. There are deep conceptualizations of democracy, where activism and organizing are more important than sheer votes, and consensus democracy, but in the popular imagination it\u0026rsquo;s a majoritarian practice. But our “robust consultation processes” are anything but majoritarian. They’re whiter and richer than society as a whole, and are made up almost exclusively of incumbent property owners. And unlike voting, they’re not a measured and observable process - advocates for a particular decision, like the recent Villiers Island proposal in Toronto-Danforth where advocates asked for more density and housing in the plan, can massively outweigh the detractors of a plan (or supporters of a plan deemed insufficient), but despite writing more letters, having more people speak on an item, and out organizing their opponents, they lose.\nAnd finally, democracy is not a legalistic practice, but that’s very much what our housing proposals are. I’m trying to avoid using too much planning jargon - it’s alienating and annoying - but I’ll get into it a bit here. If someone wants to build, say, a 4 unit apartment in Toronto, they need approvals. Technically, 4 plexes are allowed city wide due to the Expanding Housing Options in Neighbourhoods policies passed a couple years ago. However, those policies restrict the height, depth, and width of a given building that make it almost impossible to build “as-of-right”, by which I mean going to the building department with an application and getting a permit in short order. Instead, you need a planning process before you can get a building permit. For a small proposal, most of this will go through the Committee of Adjustment, an adjudicative board made up of “subject matter experts”, appointed by City Council. The developer will seek “variances”, which are alterations to the existing bylaw that the applicant wishes to have deemed minor and acceptable by the board. There are tests for this under the planning act, but again, this is all a bit more wishy-washy than one would hope - an example might be that the zoning bylaw says that the building can only be 12 metres tall, but to fit 4 stories and build 4 units, the applicant needs to build something that’s 13 or so metres tall. Is that minor? You would think so, but not always.\nBut the adjudicators don’t make the decision in a vacuum. City planning will opt whether or not to write into the committee - of note, they will never write in support of a variance, only in opposition. City Councillors can also write in with their opinion - as the committee is supposed to be arms-length and is appointed by city council, some view it as inappropriate, but others are happy to write in. And neighbours can write in support or opposition, though importantly, Committee members are meant to take into account the geographic proximity of the people writing in. If you would like to move into a neighbourhood and that would be facilitated in part due to a theoretical development, your opinion is judged as lesser than your prospective neighbour who already lives there. So then the decision goes ahead.\nBut that’s not the end. These decisions can be taken to the Toronto Local Appeals Body (TLAB), which was an appeals adjudicative board constituted because the provincial Local Planning Appeals Tribunal/Ontario Municipal Board/Ontario Land Tribunal was so clogged with appeals and fights. And the TLAB decision is, technically, not the end - opponents can appeal to the courts if they decide that there was an error in law, potentially snaring up a development at 3 different levels of justice, with lawyers and planners and experts the whole way, and extremely little in the way of what’s usually considered democracy.\nBut there’s another question about democracy in the development process - what is local democracy? Well, I could say that corruption is a form of local democracy. That sounds provocative, and it’s meant to! But I think it’s also true. Because democracy is a discretionary process. The idea of democracy is that there is a set of rules, and then people get to influence decisions within that ruleset. They’ll influence it through neighbourhood groups, political parties, activist organizations, and, yes, lobbies. Local democracy, especially in cities the size of Toronto, used to be based around machine politics, where political parties and actors would reward supporters with jobs and graft and goodies. This world embraced corruption as a form of local politics. That kind of literal brown envelope democracy has been formally erased, but there are still obvious examples of graft that pop up now and again, and lots of soft graft, where things are not necessarily illegal, but definitely untoward. And corruption, or cash for access, is high proof lobbying. The everclear of lobbying.\nI know this is provocative, so I want to give an example. Let’s say you have a development in a “sensitive neighbourhood”. A local neighbourhood organization opposes it. When that neighbourhood organization calls and emails and asks for meetings with a city councillor about the development, their leverage in those conversations is that they will vote, donate, and organize against the councillor in their reelection if the development goes the developers way. When the developers calls and emails and asks for meetings with a city councillor, they’re also saying they will donate and organize against the councillor (they probably don’t live in the riding) if it the proposal doesn’t go their way, but also, maybe the councillor’s son or husband or chief of staff will get a nice job if it does go their way. I think it’s a morally despicable form of local democracy, but when you introduce a level of discretion into a process, the input that people get is relative to their power - economic, racial, gender, class, etc - and so a developer wielding that power is a version of democracy.\nOur local experts, affordable housing providers, and City Council decisions state that our existing processes, fees, and prices are a barrier to housing production, and a small number of unrepresentative actors use legal methods to abuse those processes to further slow housing production, all in the name of democracy.\nWhat is to be done? Look, there’s about a hundred good books and articles out there about what generally needs to happen to build better cities, and most of their suggestions would be enormous improvements. Arbitrary Lines, Fixer Upper, Our Crumbling Foundations, Home Truths, The Affordable City. There would need to be Ontario specific changes due to our laws and systems, but those are minor adjustments. It boils down to a need for subsidized housing and procedural reform.\nCouncillor Perks and the rest of the progressive movement are absolutely correct when they talk about the need for greater public provision of affordable housing. The fact of the matter is that housing is so unaffordable for so many people now that if the market can correct for it, it will take a generation or more before low income people can afford a decent place in a market rate unit, and those people need assistance immediately. Public funding of attainable and deeply affordable housing is necessary.\nBut as was said in an earlier part of this essay, our processes and zoning need to be cleaned up. What’s key to understand here is that the City, if it chooses to build affordable apartments, isn’t some magical beast that doesn’t have to obey zoning laws and other planning regulations. The City of Toronto is, under Ontario law, basically a corporation, and that corporation\u0026rsquo;s development requests are bound by all applicable provincial planning frameworks as well as the local bylaws. If anything, it’s more bound by them, because the City’s development corporation can’t take City Planning to an appeals body if it makes a decision that the public development corporation doesn’t like, and that means the conservative impulse in City Planning has much more leverage than in an application with a private developer. The public corporation has to obey the laws to the letter, while most development that happens in Toronto is the case of the city saying “you can’t build anything here”, the applicant asking to build the Burj Khalifa, and the result being somewhere in the middle after an extremely long, quasi legal process.\nAn example of this problem is when the city decided to build some deeply affordable apartments in Davenport, East York, and Willowdale. Planning didn’t object to the proposal, despite it not conforming with the laws, but planning staff flagged to council that the process to allow this subsidized housing could take years. The city needed to write to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and request what’s known as a “Ministerial Zoning Order”, which overrules the city’s planning laws. So there was a situation where the city was trying to build something that it said shouldn’t be allowed, and rather than reform the laws, asked a higher order of government to overrule itself. And because one of them was in a constituency that was important to the provincial government, it took years of additional process to get built, and costs exorbitantly more than the others which didn’t have to go through a process.\nSimilarly, the city can’t pick certain bodies - like non-profits, land trusts, cooperatives - and deem them as immune from planning rules. We see this problem of process again when the city decided to permit buildings with between 2-4 units city wide. They did that, it was great, but they also introduced a series of regulations which makes them financially unfeasible to build in almost all cases in the current market. Not affordable apartments, which would require subsidy - I’m talking market rate apartments, sometimes impossible to build profitably even if the land is free. A city whose Official Plan says that 4 storey buildings are generally considered city wide, and recently passed a much ballyhooed plan to legalize 4 unit apartment buildings, also passed a height overlay map where the tallest buildings can be without a planning process is 12 metres. The problem? Well, a storey is usually at least 3.2 metres, if not more, meaning it’s pretty near impossible to build a 4 story apartment without the building being 13 or more metres. Take an organization like Circle Land Trust, a great organization that inherited a bunch of Toronto Community Housing’s single family homes. They’re holding somewhere in the range of 600 buildings, many with 1 unit. They could quadruple their offerings under the Expanding Housing Options in Neighbourhoods reforms, but to do so, they’d need to go through a planning process on every single application, and they don’t have the organizational capacity or the money to do so.\nWhat’s infuriating is the places that Councillor Perks points at - Vienna, Stockholm - recognize this. The zoning in these cities is massively more permissive than in Toronto, and is often less consultative. Rather than consulting on every individual project, politicians run on platforms about how housing should be constructed, and the city does much larger consultations on the vision document for the city. The City of Toronto has zoning bylaws specific to small neighbourhoods that no one was ever consulted on, and pre-dates every councillor currently serving by 4 decades, and they bind massive amounts of our land to the past. And Vienna has poured huge resources into speeding up permitting, with the Social Democratic government recognizing that time is money, and spending time debating the shape and size of housing creates longer waitlists and more immiseration. And closer to home, so does the biggest social democratic government in North America - BC’s NDP government passed massive housing reforms, recognizing that slow processes and bad faith actors were contributing to their housing crisis.\nProcess and subsidy are inextricably linked. The city is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on every affordable house we try and build, because our own system does not want us to build affordable housing. We have a machine gun aimed at our foot and the trigger is pulled, and we can’t figure out why our feet hurt, and the sooner our progressive politicians recognize that, the sooner we can fix it.\nHowever, I’ll say I have some criticisms of the political strategy espoused by some YIMBY groups, particularly their courting of free market conservatives as a route to reform, as well as some policies advocated by right wing members of the coalition, such as elimination of rent control. I don’t think that there are enough free market believers in most conservative coalitions, and judging by rhetoric and action from Doug Ford to John Rustad to Donald Trump to Rishi Sunak, I think I’m right in that belief. And I also think that eliminating rent control would have disastrous effects on existing tenants without directly creating new housing. I think those views have been born out - Doug Ford promised to build a lot of housing, and one of his routes to doing so was eliminating rent controls on new builds. There’s maybe some evidence that buildings which would have previously been condominium are now rental towers, but housing starts aren’t meaningfully up since his election and removal of rent controls, and his reforms to process have been minimal at best.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThough it is in some areas due to increased housing consumption by households\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://ammacmahon.github.io/posts/planning/","summary":"I can’t afford a decent place in Toronto.

But an artist closer to pension age than college parties, anyway. The expectations of all the young artists who are elevated by their peers and mentors in school, then maybe in post-secondary, then in some early festivals and engagements, but then start to see the reality - the whole arts landscape in Canada, and honestly across most of the world, is held together with dental floss.\nIn a separate thread he mentioned that students should be exposed to the amount of money they’re likely to make over the course of their careers. Some, like Ric Waugh (hey Ric!) said they do expose students to those realities, but students tend to think they’ll beat the odds. I remember hearing teachers talk about their dire finances, and they eventually got tenured University jobs, so by definition they were doing way better than most. And hell, I was that student - I went through the program, and thought I could beat the odds!\nBut the conversation made me think - what the hell are we doing with acting training in this country?\nI’m going to speak pretty directly about jobs and money in this piece, because jobs and money satisfy all the lower parts of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and should be forefront in our minds when we design programs that determine what someone will do for the rest of their life. Yes, the arts are great because they create transcendent experiences and connect us with other humans, and yes, school is great because it allows you to become your own person, but a transcendent experience, becoming your own person, and three dollars gets you a cup of coffee. Artists are low income people, rent is profoundly expensive in most Canadian cities, and the price of education is extremely high. This was not always the case - relative rents in many Canadian cities were lower in previous decades, arts funding was higher in real dollars, and education was more heavily subsidized, so dreaming away at school may have been feasible in a different age, but it’s not anymore.\nI’m also speaking mostly about acting, even though it’s only part of the theatre and film ecosystem, which exist in the arts \u0026amp; entertainment world. I speak about acting training because many playwrights, directors, and stage managers start out in acting school, and even in film schools, pedagogy often focuses on acting, even if many film school students end up working in crews. And I’m thinking about theatre and film because relative to incomes, it seems like acting schools ballooned. There aren’t 20 colleges in Ontario offering Opera or Poetry degrees, but acting schools are everywhere now.\nAs I see it, there are a few separate tranches of arts instruction in Canada. Universities, which typically offer BA or BFA programs in Drama/Theatre/Acting, sometimes with a minor, with a blend of conservatory training and liberal arts education; Colleges, which offer 2-3 year diploma programs, mostly conservatory training with some technical or business courses; and private training, which can run the gamut from audition classes in someone’s living room/zoom to cults to private film schools which will take as much money as you’ll throw at them and that, if you’re lucky, might connect you with a university so you can eventually get a degree.\nUniversity drama programs are…whatever. They are where you study drama, partly academically, partly practically. I graduated from one, and like all liberal arts education programs, it sends a certain class signal that you went to a University, and also allows you to ladder into other University programs - MFA, MBAs, MPAs (me, it’s me), B.Ed, JD, MDiv, whatever. When the University graduate realizes they’ll never make it in the arts industry, they have a piece of paper that might allow them to get another piece of paper that can get them what’s left of a middle class life in Canada. The quality of the acting training at Universities is all over the place, but in more than a few cases it’s the only arts training and arts production for miles around, and it’s part of a holistic education system (just as Drama students need to take Physics, some Physics students need to take Drama), so whatever, it’s fine for the purpose of this investigation.\nPrivate institutions are…well, again, some of them are literally cults, others are small businesses, and some are giant institutions that pretend to be legitimate schools and actually are just a way to burn through lots of money. I tend to think the first should be investigated by the RCMP, the third should be regulated by the ministries of Education, and the second should be watched like a hawk less it turns into the first or third. But actors and people in the industry demand these courses for professional development and networking, and you don’t want to be so heavy handed with regulation that you ban legitimate small businesses, so they should probably exist.\nBut what boggles my mind is just how many college programs there are. I’m going to speak about Ontario for a bit, because it’s almost half the country’s population, is disproportionately productive compared to the non-English part of the other half when it comes to arts, and is also where most of the arts training takes place. Ontario Colleges were created during the Davis government in the 60s, with the idea of providing vocational, technological, and general education. They are, at their heart, job training institutions. If you go to acting school at a college, you are not there to study drama - you\u0026rsquo;re there to train as an actor. I think that\u0026rsquo;s an incredibly important distinction. The colleges also offer continuing education, and general education is part of the mandate, but enrolling in most Ontario college programs - practical nursing, IT, trades, etc, is done with the idea of job placement. Ontario Colleges website lists at least 11 separate streams of acting, but 18 for theatre performance. If you blend all the programs that are acting adjacent at Ontario colleges, there are certainly more than 20, maybe high 20s. Each of these programs can be 15 or 20 students, meaning Ontario colleges are graduating maybe 400 new actors per year.\nThese are programs that are publicly supported - the buildings and staff are paid for with tax dollars, and the student tuition doesn\u0026rsquo;t nearly cover those costs. Some of the tuition is also tax subsidized, through programs like OSAP, which helps low income students attend college and university. And they’re regulated through the ministry of education, so there should theoretically be value for money audits and industry placement statistics routinely performed.\nAnd my question is…how do these colleges pass those value for money audits? If you’re subsidizing an industry through grants and job training in an area that doesn’t have a mature industry of that sort, the hope is that eventually the industry will be self-supporting. This is always a bit tricky in arts and culture, because most of the industry relies on cross subsidies, partnerships, grants, philanthropy, but there are sustainable non-profit theatres across the country which get relatively little public funding and can produce quite a lot of theatre. It’s not clear to me that this is the case with regional acting colleges.\nI tend to think that artistic production is good for an economy - there’s always a lot of creative accounting done by tourism boards and arts agencies that say “every dollar invested in the arts turns out $7”, but those kinds of multiplier effects are usually a joke. However, I think it’s pretty clear that there’s a causal relationship between artistic production in a geography and returns to hospitality, tourism, and retail in a given location. Clearly the Stratford Festival costs a lot of government dollars, but it also absorbs a much larger amount of private dollars through donations and ticket sales, and the town of Stratford is one of the nicest in the country due to the amount of money flowing through it, most of which stems from the festival. You can’t, unfortunately, set up an internationally renowned Shakespeare festival in every old mining and pig rendering town, but if you got in while the getting was good, it was a great economic development strategy. But it’s clear that putting a theatre program in a small town, which has huge operating subsidies and relatively low private inputs, doesn’t revitalize an economy in the same way.\nThe bigger problem is the output. Think about the amount of students we accept into training programs, and the amount of jobs on the other end. In Canada, we do a form of central planning for doctors. Arguably we train too few - I think way too few - but that system ensures job placements so well that when a resident can’t match with a job, it’s a national news story. Our engineering, commerce, agriculture, and other STEM programs don’t have such a quota system, but those job markets are pretty flexible, and most engineers and accountants find work that’s adjacent to their field. Graduates of the arts and humanities at Universities often have trouble finding good or stable work (again, it’s me), but the data is usually clear that those with these degrees make more money than those without. And graduates of trade schools can do apprenticeships, which, while also often problematic and locked up, can usually find them work.\nActing graduates from colleges? It’s a whole different world. ACTRA put out some statistics from their census (which I got from Ric Waugh - hi again!), showing the percentage of card carrying ACTRA members who earn most of their income from acting is, at most, 2%.\n2%. 1 in 50 union actors makes a living doing their craft. Imagine for a second that only 2% of doctors found placements. Or engineers, or accountants, or carpenters, or any other job.\nYou’d shut all those schools down and think again, right?\nBut for the most part, we don’t. There are over 20 college job training programs producing some 400+ actors every year in this province. Sure, Humber’s performing arts stream was shut down. That was a small tragedy in the Toronto community, and for good reason - lots of artists got some of their work there! And their graduates were often very good actors. Humber probably shouldn’t have been first on the chopping block, but when you compare the amount of actors this province trains with the amount of working actors, some programs have to get chopped.\nMaybe this is an austerity mindset, but even in the most fantastical scenarios, there’s a limit to how many actors in our contemporary economy can make a living plying their craft. Having a huge surplus of actors pumped out by our colleges makes that number lower, weakens existing actors\u0026rsquo; efforts at the bargaining table, and doesn’t necessarily produce better art at the end of the day. There’s a reason there are so many rich kids in acting nowadays, and it’s because they have the financial security to do good work, take their time, and be creative. If the rest of actors are part of - to use a Marxist term - the reserve army of labour, where they’re working crappy jobs and shooting self tapes in the few minutes between shifts, they’ll get crowded out by people with family money.\nBy limiting the amount of acting programs, we could limit the supply of actors in Ontario competing for these parts, and by redirecting the funds away from training programs towards operating and project funding for theatres and film production companies, we could increase the amount of work available. If only 2% of film actors are getting routine enough work to pay the bills, then these training institutions are serving acting teachers better than they’re serving actors, and while it’s great for actors to get work teaching - most other artistic professions supplement their incomes with teaching - if there are that many unemployed actors in the province, it doesn’t make sense to subsidize the teaching of more. We should close some of these programs down and transfer the money into artistic production in regions where there’s already an acting industry.\nI’m aware there are very good arguments against this, and I’d like to address some of them:\nColleges serve Working class actors with less money and lower grades This is true. University training is more expensive than college training, and the higher admission averages bias against lower income students, who are due to societal constructs likely to have lower grades in secondary school than higher income students. As more and more arts jobs are taken by nepo babies and people from ultra elite schools (this is maybe more of a problem in the US and UK, but is an issue here as well), having acting program in colleges allows other students to access acting.\nHowever, I think it’s also true that promising low income students an acting career when 2% of actors make it (less! Because that’s the actors who have gotten into the union!) and taking their money for doing so, and keeping them out of the labour pool for two or three years is not really serving low income kids.\nThese programs bring theatre to small towns To a degree, yes. College acting programs allow there to be theatre productions that are usually of a higher calibre than secondary school theatre productions or amateur theatre. But the students are paying for the privilege of acting in these amateur productions, and it’s fairly clear many of them have little to no pathway to professionalization. The subsidies to students and schools are massive, and amateur theatre is done inexpensively - couldn’t these subsidies be directed to Little Theatres and local players groups instead? And this is also the argument for the regional theatre movement, which I think accomplishes producing art in small places more effectively than college training. Students shouldn’t have to move from their hometowns to take acting classes I’m not sure this is a defensible argument. Acting is a team art, and theatre and film thrive in congregate settings. You need large amounts of people to make audiences, you need lots of competition and networking, you need opposing points of view and working groups and festivals and late nights at openings and all that. This isn’t to say that towns can’t make great art, or people from towns can’t be good artists. Of course they can. But historically, cities produce the vast quantity of art in a given culture, because a) artists like moving to cities, and b) that’s where there are more people to work on and appreciate the art. And this is more true for performing arts than written or recorded arts. If there isn’t at least a reasonable arts industry in the town where the student trains, then they have to move as soon as they finish training, and will have to develop entirely new networks. Like I did! Believe me, it sucks! Colleges provide jobs for working actors There is some use in this argument - lots of the colleges employ working actors, and give them opportunities to do work that the industry won’t, like transitioning to directing. And it’s good pedagogy to have working actors teach young actors. Most British schools used to function this way, and many actors from the mid-century learned as apprentices in touring companies, not through formal schooling. God knows there are acting teachers in Universities who rarely acted professionally, and have little knowledge of the industry. Acting as a skill requires pedagogy and mentorship, and having working actors interact with students is good for job opportunities.\nBut crucially, those working actors should be teaching students where they do some of their work. It’s not networking to have a Toronto or Stratford actor teach a student in a small town hours away, because that doesn’t provide them meaningful work opportunities, or if it does, they’d need to move! Connected to points number two and three, they are likely to have better opportunities if their teacher works in or around the same region where they go to school.\nI think there’s also an argument like “why don’t we just put more public money into the arts and into arts training”. That would be nice, I’d support that, but like…we’re 6 years into a provincial government who doesn’t fund the arts and will probably get another majority government, and about to get a federal government who doesn’t support the arts. Every artistic director at every theatre knows we’re in an era of hard choices that’s about to become an era of much harder choices.\nAnd some people - maybe this writer, definitely lots of artists - think we don’t need a private sector, or that most of the commanding heights of the economy should be public, and when that’s the case, we’ll have lots of funding left over for all sorts of things. Whether or not that’s the case, I think lots of artists would agree that while the private sector is dominant, it would be nice if lots of the funds in that sector went to the arts rather than to other things that can take up room in discretionary spending budgets. And as small as it is, students putting their tuition money into these colleges and family and friends attending their shows is private money, and it seems to me a bad investment for future arts production. And that private money - from big musicals, from touring comedies, from film and television, it can subsidize other sections of the arts world, and we should be encouraging it. It would be nice if Canada could turn out a few more Drowsy Chaparone’s and Come From Away’s, and while one of those was indeed developed at an Ontario College, I think it’s the sole exception compared to pieces that were developed in the independents, regionals, and big players.\nThis isn’t to say public funds shouldn’t go towards the arts, even in small towns. I think there’s a good case to make - economic development and tourism, sure, but also, human expression, reason for living, all that kind of stuff. And the amount of money that the Canadian government spends on the arts is a rounding error anyway against the corporate subsidies and other spending. But it’s not clear to me that the best way to spend public arts money is in small colleges in cities with small arts scenes. To take the money that pays for land, teachers, and student tuitions, and transfer it to operating/project funds for small arts organizations in cities with big arts scenes seems like a more rational use of funds, or to transfer it to community groups, charities, or non-profit theatres that can tour or bring in actors from other areas. Or if you want to spend it all on training, why not direct it to our existing non-profit theatres - our Tarragons, London Grands, Cahoots, etc - to offer a smaller number of apprenticeships/professional development through academy programs? Toronto’s Soulpepper Academy, Regina’s Globe Theatre Conservatory, Edmonton’s Citadel/Banff training program, all three disproportionately produce working actors compared to our existing drama schools, and allows audiences to see shows with more than three cast members.\nAnd this also isn’t to denigrate the graduates of these programs. I’ve met tons of them, and they’re to-a-one as smart as graduates of other programs offered by universities and colleges. I know large numbers of Ontario college acting graduates, and they’re all equally equipped to work in corporate and service settings as my fellow graduates from the University of Saskatchewan, even though they may not have taken Chemistry and Music Theory 101 to get that rounded liberal arts education. A more dynamic private sector and less classist public sector would gladly absorb these people who are good at textual analysis, public speaking, teamwork, and many other soft skills due to their training.\nBut I think most of these schools aren’t serving anyone, besides the handful of teachers who make some decent part time money teaching an acting class here and there. It’s not a good use of public money, it’s a disservice to the students, and it adds way too much surplus labour to the industry.\nThis essay feels pretty dire. I’m essentially asking “should we stop people from pursuing their dreams”. But I don’t think we’re letting people pursue their dreams by going to schools that don’t put them on a path to success. I think we’re taking their time and their money, and trading it for a piece of paper. I certainly feel that way about my own educational experiences, and I went to schools putatively more prestigious and job oriented.\nI haven’t named any of the specific colleges that should stop offering these programs, because I genuinely like a lot of the people who work at them and graduate from them. But if you were 17 again wanting to be an actor, and you didn’t get into NTS or UofT or Studio 58, and looked at a regional acting college - would you go there? Would you tell your kids it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea?\nI know my answer.\n","permalink":"https://ammacmahon.github.io/posts/acting_training/","summary":"Michael Rubenfeld posted on Facebook about the gulf between the expectations of a young artist and the realities of an…well, I guess I’ll say old artist, even though Michael isn’t an old guy.

When Jamelle posts something, a lot of people inevitably get mad, so I’m not sure if the post is still up. But he followed it up with the idea that progressives look at issue polls, see that people generally agree with them on a given poll, and commit to mobilization strategy rather than persuasion and coalition building.\nI had a beer the other day with a friend who worked on a major progressive election campaign. They did an internal poll on upzoning to drive affordability. It was incredibly unpopular, and the policy was ditched.\nThese two things are clearly two sides of the same coin. Jamelle is right that it’s toxic to progressives. But I think it’s more than that. It’s toxic to the entire body politic.\nPolitical polling is a pretty new thing, really only coming into its own pre-WW2, and even then, it was a mess. Early methods were based on market research, where organizations like reader’s digest would collect massive amounts of responses and extrapolate those to the general population. Then Gallup came in with statistical modelling, which was a new innovation in market research. The models aimed to collect a representative sample of potential voters rather than a large sample, and it was way more accurate. There have been a bunch of improvements to the polling process, and Gallup themselves have messed up a number of times, but on the whole, the system still kinda works. Polling firms get a representative sample - usually around 1000 people, which should give an acceptably low margin of error vs price of conducting the poll, and ask a simple binary choice - Republican or Democrat. Here in Canada and other multi-party democracies the math is slightly different, but the method is exactly the same.\nWhat doesn’t seem to work as well is issue polling. In issue polling, pollsters will usually ask three types of questions:\nissue identification potential solutions desired results That’s obviously a whole different kettle of fish than binary choices. Questions about binary choices - should I vote democrat or republican, say - contain within them whole hosts of qualitative information like issue prioritization, what solutions to issues might be, what results might come of those. But the question itself is about capability and intention as a voter. A voter may follow closely or not at all, but it’s a field in which essentially everyone has the same capabilities. Some people are political professionals, but every voter is as good at voting as everyone else.\nIssue polling, on the other hand, has enormously different inputs. It’s why marketing and research need to exist - people have different levels of interest, expertise, and skin in the game for all the issues that politics might touch. Subtle changes in wording can massively change people’s opinions on a subject. Changing a questionnaire from “do you intend to vote for a Republican or a Democrat?” likely won’t have a much different result from “would you rather a Republican or Democrat win the election?”. Changing a question from “do you think your city needs more apartments?” is going to have a massively different result from “do you think there should be more apartments near your house?”.\nThis was seen in the United States with questions around Medicare for All. Questions broadly phrased as “do you support Medicare for All” have enormous political support. But that doesn’t really mean anything. Medicare is a currently existing program that the people who use usually like. Medicare for All is a branding about getting rid of the current healthcare system and replacing it with a single government payer, like in Canada. Every question that was more specific polled worse the more specific it got - would you be okay with raising taxes to pay for it, would you be okay with potentially increased wait times, would you be okay with people in the insurance industry losing their jobs, would you be okay with losing your current service provider, etc.\nNone of that is meant to denigrate Medicare for All as an idea. Even a pretty sloppy implementation would probably be better in a lot of ways than the current American system, which has a whole bunch of people uninsured, a bunch of people underinsured, tons of people with awful copays and premiums, and oodles of bureaucracy and administrative spending. But people aren’t experts on that, and they have things they like about their current situation. Union members and professionals in America often have health care plans that are the envy of the world, with broad and deep coverage for a range of health adjacent services. They clearly wouldn’t want to lose that and go on basic Medicare, and that fear would be reflected in the polls, which can’t contain every contingency.\nBut there was a candidate who ran mostly on Medicare for All, and he was pretty damn popular. He almost got the nomination in 2016 for the party that ended up winning the popular vote, and he won several major states and was a frontrunner in 2020 for the party that won the popular vote and eventually the election. While campaigning on the issue opened him up to some attacks, it’s tough to say it hurt him, considering he was an underperforming senator from a very small state who almost became the president.\nIssue polling fails because it limits political imagination. Bernie identified healthcare as a problem facing voters in 2016 and 2020. He took a swing on a solution that was popular in the abstract, but extremely unpopular in the details. But he didn’t run on the details, and people didn’t fault him for it. The position definitely opened him up to attacks, and because he made improving medical coverage in the US table stakes, now there are clips of candidate Kamala Harris saying she’d like to ban private insurance. That’s not great for her, and a large amount of clips like that can add up in people’s perception, but again, it’s far from destructive. Because a voter answering extremely specific policy questions on the phone and checking a box in a voting booth are fundamentally different things.\nSame thing with upzoning, or other similar policies. Clearly this campaign recognized people prioritized the housing crisis. When asked by a polling firm on the phone if they support upzoning the whole city, they probably think that means there’ll be a 30 story tower built right next to their house. That would happen to vanishingly few people, probably about the same amount as it happens to now. But even raising that question, and getting that bad answer, makes politicians take viable solutions out of contention before they’re even on the table. And that’s a huge problem.\n","permalink":"https://ammacmahon.github.io/posts/polling/","summary":"Jamelle Bouie posted on BlueSky about issue polling being the worst thing that has happened to progressives. When Jamelle posts something, a lot of people inevitably get mad, so I’m not sure if the post is still up.

Pretextual planning is fairly self explanatory - a city (or other level of government, or maybe a private business or NGO) creates a plan, and elements of that plan are a pretext for doing something else.\nThe strong towns argument brings up parking requirements, which are a horrible policy idea that forces developers to build expensive parking, despite small and midsized cities having a massive parking surplus, and large cities trying to redevelop parking into higher order uses like housing, public amenities, and employment sites. Planners use parking minimums as a pretext for getting concessions from developers. When I worked as a planning advisor, the parking minimums in downtown Toronto (which have since been eliminated - except for in rooming houses, which is completely pretextual to ban rooming houses) were egregious, and no planner enforced them. Rather, they used them as a bargaining chip to get more community benefits, or a donation towards something like a Bike Share station.\nThis was unaccountable and in my opinion undermines public trust, but it’s also pretty small beans. The bike share station might have been something like half a million dollars. That’s three downtown parking spots, maybe. Any developer would be happy to make that trade to lose a 50 spot requirement. It’s unprincipled, but again, small beans.\nThe problem is that small beans add up. Big developers can afford the lawyers and planners to get around them, but that ultimately raises the prices of homes by both diluting the supply (small builders can’t enter the market) and by increasing soft costs like legal fees. And there’s pretext everywhere in society, especially in public administration, and it creates layers of uncertainty that drives up costs and decreases transparency and public accountability. It’s obvious in municipal planning documents because a) they’re public documents, and b) they’re openly contradictory.\nI think this is most clearly seen in Toronto’s building heights.\nThere’s a ton of planning documents that builders have to go through, but the main pieces are the official plan and the zoning bylaw(s). The official plan speaks at a high level to the type of buildings and communities that the city wants to see. It’s the guiding document for council’s land use strategy. If council were a business, this would be the business plan that they’d present to banks and lenders, would be the public facing “about us” page, and would inform all communications sent to customers. The zoning bylaw is the equivalent of regulations and standard operating procedures - heights, lot sizes, units per lot, distance from the street, etc.\nYou would think, if you wanted to design good bylaws, you could have them facilitate the objectives in your plan. If you were running a business that was creating a new email service, and your business plan said “our emails send with less than 1 second delay”, an internal control that delayed each email send by say, 6 hours, would be absolutely ludicrous. You may wish to have controls for certain reasons - say, emails that seem confidential are delayed by some period of time, or emails that are written in a rage, or something along those lines. Your regulations or standard operating procedures would be written to facilitate the desired outcome, with controls for exceptions and potential problems.\nToronto has decided to do it backwards. The city’s official plan speaks to neighbourhoods, which are the largest single land use in Toronto. In the plan’s definition, a neighbourhood “is made up of residential uses in lower scale buildings such as detached houses, semi-detached houses, duplexes, triplexes and townhouses, as well as interspersed walk-up apartments that are no higher than four storeys”. A further item mentions “four storeys or less”. One would think that the neighbourhood designation in the zoning bylaw, more or less, allows for four storeys.\nBut that’s not the case. Toronto’s City Council recently went through a large scale review of the zoning code to allow for duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in neighbourhoods, where they were previously banned (despite, again, clearly being referenced in the definition). The planning department then went through the neighbourhood height overlay map, which is a separate zoning bylaw that speaks to building heights allowed as of right.\nThe resulting recommendations - where heights were less than 10m, allow up to 10m. Where heights were between 10-12m, allow 12m. In imperial units, that’s about 32’10” or 39’4”.\nThe problem is that 12m/39’4” is too short. A standard residential storey is 9 feet of living space plus 1 foot of mechanical between stories. If your building starts absolutely at grade, you’re building 40 feet, and that’s before thinking about the pitch of the roof, which in a potentially snowy city like Toronto is important.\nSo despite an official plan that says 4 storeys are allowed in neighbourhoods, and a years long compliance exercise to allow 4 unit buildings that are potentially 4 storeys, there are 0 neighbourhoods where a normal 4 storey building is allowed as-of-right.\nThis seems like small beans, right? If you’re allowed to build 39’4” and your proposed building is 40’, surely there must be a way to get that rule slightly bent. And there is. The city has something called The Committee of Adjustment, which allows for variances to the zoning bylaw. All you need to do is pay thousands of dollars for your committee application, pay for a planning deputation by an accredited planner, wait the 3-6 months for your committee appointment while paying any costs on the land, and survive potentially hundreds of letters of objection from local busybodies. Then you might get approval from a committee of unaccountable and unelected adjudicators, and you can build a type of building the city says that it wants and that it allows.\nClearly this is absurd. No one starting from first principles would design a system like this. No one starting a private business would make their business operate like this. And this is the type of governmental policy that makes normal people into libertarians - the idea that thousands of little items in government policy are poorly thought out, or are very well thought out to benefit certain groups - in this case, NIMBYs, but in other cases, interest groups or whatever other shadowy group may exist.\nGood government reformers should be obsessed with cleaning up existing problems like this, and public servants should have a culture that makes their recommendations textual, not pretextual. If politicians want to muddle with recommendations, fine. They’re elected, they’re accountable for their actions. But when planning staff came forward with a recommendation to allow four storeys, and a zoning bylaw that banned four storeys, that was an exercise in cynicism, and should be seen as such.\n","permalink":"https://ammacmahon.github.io/posts/mypost/","summary":"Sean Galbraith and Strong Towns have both talked about pretextual planning.
