      <description>I can’t afford a decent place in Toronto. It&amp;rsquo;s a shitty situation, and it’s something I think about all the time. My bathroom is covered in mold, my kitchen has mice and roaches, and our old windows leak cold air in the summer and warm air in the winter. And I’m a well paid public servant living in a rent controlled apartment! Things could be ten times worse. It’s abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that housing prices have become divorced from incomes in Toronto, and across Canada, and people have all sorts of explanations.</description>

      <title>Pretextual Planning</title>

      <description>Sean Galbraith and Strong Towns have both talked about pretextual planning. Pretextual planning is fairly self explanatory - a city (or other level of government, or maybe a private business or NGO) creates a plan, and elements of that plan are a pretext for doing something else.
The strong towns argument brings up parking requirements, which are a horrible policy idea that forces developers to build expensive parking, despite small and midsized cities having a massive parking surplus, and large cities trying to redevelop parking into higher order uses like housing, public amenities, and employment sites.</description>
