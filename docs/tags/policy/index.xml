      <description>Acting Training in Canada
Michael Rubenfeld posted on Facebook about the gulf between the expectations of a young artist and the realities of an…well, I guess I’ll say old artist, even though Michael isn’t an old guy. But an artist closer to pension age than college parties, anyway. The expectations of all the young artists who are elevated by their peers and mentors in school, then maybe in post-secondary, then in some early festivals and engagements, but then start to see the reality - the whole arts landscape in Canada, and honestly across most of the world, is held together with dental floss.</description>

      <title>Pretextual Planning</title>

      <description>Sean Galbraith and Strong Towns have both talked about pretextual planning. Pretextual planning is fairly self explanatory - a city (or other level of government, or maybe a private business or NGO) creates a plan, and elements of that plan are a pretext for doing something else.
The strong towns argument brings up parking requirements, which are a horrible policy idea that forces developers to build expensive parking, despite small and midsized cities having a massive parking surplus, and large cities trying to redevelop parking into higher order uses like housing, public amenities, and employment sites.</description>
