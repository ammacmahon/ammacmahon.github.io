## Full Length Plays

#### [The Jungle (Co-written with Thomas McKechnie)](https://www.playwrightscanada.com/Books/T/The-Jungle)
1m/1f, 90min, drama

Can Jack and Veronyka ever get ahead? In this all-too-relatable love story in a city suffocating under late-stage capitalism, a young couple is pitted against odd after odd in a way that isn’t about testing one’s character anymore — it’s simply reality.
#### [The Dead (Adapted from the short story by James Joyce)](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3178309/the-dead)
4m/4f, 90min, drama/adaptation

Gabriel Conroy attends a Christmastime party thrown by his aunts, the events of which force him to reflect on his life and his place in the universe.

#### Animal Farm (Not available for production outside of Canada - contact for script)
8, 120min, epic/dark comedy

The tyrannical Farmer Jones must be overthrown! How long will the animal utopia last when a charismatic new leader emerges? An innovative new adaptation of Orwell’s classic satire bites just as much today as when it was first written.

3m/2f, 90min, drama

An anarchist holds the world’s secrets on a hard drive. Three developers try and disrupt stagnant markets, missed connections, and freedom of speech. A venture capitalist finds his profit in the rubble. The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.

#### [Wild Dogs on the Moscow Trains](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3178308/wild-dogs-on-the-moscow-trains)
2m/1f, 90min, drama

Three young Russians come to terms with political freedoms and flesh eating drugs in a world where animals are becoming human and humans behave like animals.

#### [The Frenzy of Queen Maeve](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3178301/the-frenzy-of-queen-maeve)
2m/1f, 90min, dark comedy

Set in 1970s Northern Ireland, The Frenzy of Queen Maeve focuses on one woman’s choice between two lovers and two lives. Should she stay with her true love, an IRA operative, or go with her wealthy English boyfriend to a better life?


## Short plays

#### [Losing Reykjavik](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3179207/losing-reykjavik)
1m/1f, 10min

A young couple experience turbulence in their relationship and on their flight.

#### [Litany](https://newplayexchange.org/script/3179203/litany)
1m/1f, 10min

A couple meet at a funeral

#### AstroNOTs
This is an old comedy I wrote for the Fringe when I was 19. It's probably not worth reading, so I didn't link the script, but at some point two English guys turned it into a musical. That's kind of funny.

## Other

I write some other things and send them out into the world. Sometimes people even read them.
