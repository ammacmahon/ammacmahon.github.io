I can’t afford a decent place in Toronto. It's a shitty situation, and it’s something I think about all the time. My bathroom is covered in mold, my kitchen has mice and roaches, and our old windows leak cold air in the summer and warm air in the winter. And I’m a well paid public servant living in a rent controlled apartment! Things could be ten times worse. It’s abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that housing prices have become divorced from incomes in Toronto, and across Canada, and people have all sorts of explanations.

On that note, Councillor Gord Perks of Ward 4 (Parkdale-High Park) in Toronto recently made some claims about Toronto’s housing crisis, which was followed up by a piece in [Storeys](https://storeys.com/gord-perks-toronto-housing-crisis/), one of Toronto’s development/real estate verticals.

As the chair of the planning and housing committee at Toronto City Hall and one of the longest standing progressives at City Council, his remarks are important, because they reflect a view among progressive Torontonians about the roots of the housing crisis and solutions to it. His comments also made a lot of people in the broad Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) coalition upset, and I think for good reason.

I want to analyze his remarks, and suggest some changes to his analysis of the current state of affairs in Toronto. Sorry this piece is so long. A better writer would split it into multiple posts, but I'm not a better writer.

## Background/Why am I doing this?

Councillor Gord Perks took over the planning and housing committee from Brad Bradford after the resignation of John Tory and subsequent election of Olivia Chow as mayor. It’s clearly a coveted position for him, with Gord publicly weighing in on Toronto planning policy for years in the media and online. To some, Gord represents a break from Brad Bradford and his predecessor Ana Bailao tenures as chair, moving the ideological and practical centre of the committee away from a market/YIMBY view of housing to a social/NIMBY view of housing. I think this view is massively overstated for a couple reasons. Firstly, conservative mayors continually stuck progressives on the planning committee (along with public health and a couple other less prestigious committees) in an effort to defang them, and take them away from committees like the budget committee. While Brad and Ana were friends of those conservative mayors, they were in the left part of those mayoral coalitions. Secondly, Gord, Ana, and Brad vote or voted together on almost every social and market reform that came before council. Brad’s mayoral run and voting record since the election of Olivia Chow aside, the degree of ideological difference between Toronto-East York councillors - where Brad, Ana, and Gord work - is much smaller than the difference between T-EY councillors and councillors from the inner suburbs, which are often vastly more reform minded than councillors from the outer suburbs. But this shift is frustrating to groups like More Neighbours Toronto, HousingNOW Toronto, and other volunteer or business interests that are counted in the YIMBY coalition.

To be frank, I count myself as broadly sympathetic to that coalition, placing myself on its left fringe (Read [The Affordable City](https://islandpress.org/books/affordable-city#desc)). I think the basic statement that housing prices are a result of low supply, and that low supply is partly driven by lengthy, uncertain, and byzantine processes to be at least part of the explanation for the housing crisis.[^1]
[^1]:  However, I’ll say I have some criticisms of the political strategy espoused by some YIMBY groups, particularly their courting of free market conservatives as a route to reform, as well as some policies advocated by right wing members of the coalition, such as elimination of rent control. I don’t think that there are enough free market believers in most conservative coalitions, and judging by rhetoric and action from Doug Ford to John Rustad to Donald Trump to Rishi Sunak, I think I’m right in that belief. And I also think that eliminating rent control would have disastrous effects on existing tenants without directly creating new housing. I think those views have been born out - Doug Ford promised to build a lot of housing, and one of his routes to doing so was eliminating rent controls on new builds. There’s maybe some evidence that buildings which would have previously been condominium are now rental towers, but housing starts aren’t meaningfully up since his election and removal of rent controls, and his reforms to process have been minimal at best.

I’m writing this because I think Gord is an intelligent guy, and is open to having his mind changed if presented with a compelling argument supported by facts. Research about changing people’s minds supports the idea  that most people are open to having their minds changed, even on deeply held beliefs, unless people are rude to them. While groups like More Neighbours generally approach Toronto politicians with a more positive or conciliatory tone, there’s no shortage of actors in the housing space who think you catch more flies with vinegar. It’s frustrating having to be nice to powerful people you believe to be wrong, but it’s not supported by data that being negative works, and it’s frankly damaging to the human soul to be angry all the time. The other democratic way of changing Gord’s mind, or effectively doing so, is electing someone else as the member of council for Ward 4. However, it’s not clear to me that Chemi Lhamo or Siri Agrell, the two runners up in 2022, were more supportive of a broadly YIMBY agenda than Gord, so I think debating with Gord is the best path for the moment.

Who am I to do this? Well, no one really. I’m not an elected official, though I did work as a planning advisor to Joe Cressy, Gord’s friend and colleague on city council. I’m not a planner or a land economist, but then again, neither is Gord, so I’m disagreeing with him as an equal when it comes to credentials. Instead, I’m relying on the work of planners, economists, advocates, architects, and builders as I go through his claims item by item.

## What is Gord’s argument?

I don’t want to misrepresent Gord’s argument, so most of what I talk about here will be in response to direct quotes and summaries of quotes from the Storey’s article.
> About zoning and city processes, Gord dismissed arguments that zoning by-laws, fees and fines, and a"robust" public consultation process are barriers to housing, calling the claims "utterly, utterly false."

> About the interaction between the city/government and the market, Gord claims that Government action is not why there’s a housing affordability crisis in Toronto and that Toronto's development industry that has limited the creation of the type of housing the City needs

> About the recency of the housing crisis, Gord claims that "Prior to 2010, there was a reliable relationship between people’s incomes and rent and mortgage cost. In order for the argument that zoning and fees are the problem to make sense, something would have had to happen in zoning and fees sometime 10 to 15 years ago, that suddenly changed the relationship, and nothing happened."

> About the reach of these problems, Gord claims “Firstly, It’s not a local problem. This is a global problem. Every major urban area we have any information about is going through an affordability crisis," Perks tells STOREYS. The problem, summarized by Perks, is one of income inequality and wealth distribution on a global scale.

> Narrowing down on that question of reach about the issue being with capitalism and income inequality, Gord claims "Probably about three quarters of all wealth in the world right now is tied up in real estate.” That money is “accumulating with the wealthy, and instead of building factories they're buying land, so the price of land has skyrocketed."

> About the difference between eras in market housing, Gord claims "In 1970 or so, a developer would build a building and own it, and they were in for a long haul," he says. "Now you have a whole class that is turning over land fast and then handing it over to a condominium corporation. So you have this quick return thing going on." At the same time, he explains, a building won't get constructed without pre-selling at least 70% of its units — the majority of which are bought by investors who then turn them into rentals or just sit on them forever.

> About the solution, Gord claims "So you have all these market things going on that are utterly outside of the ability of municipalities to do anything about," Perks says. To him, the solution to this inherently capitalistic model is its inverse: social housing. "If you look around the world, historically, no one, ever, anywhere, has solved a housing affordability problem through the private market," he says. Instead, he points to places like Vienna and Stockholm, where their governments have invested robustly in social housing.

## What are the theories of the housing crisis?
I’m going to look at two main theories of the crisis - the one that Gord is arguing against, and the one he is broadly arguing for.

The theory that Gord broadly defines as “market urbanist” is a neoclassical economic theory. The main claim is that housing prices are determined by supply and demand, with the price being determined at the level where supply and demand curves meet. Housing supply is too low, which means that demand exceeds supply, raising the price. That’s illustrated by the following graph: S is the previous state of supply, S1 is the current state of supply. As the supply curve moves to the left - decreasing relative to demand - P shifts upward to P1.

![Supply decrease](https://github.com/ammacmahon/ammacmahon.github.io/blob/main/assets/SupplyDecrease.jpg?raw=true)

I’ll note that supply of apartments isn’t necessarily decreasing - apartments in Toronto are clearly being built![^2]  But supply is decreasing relative to demand. You could also say the demand curve is moving to the right, with increased immigration and smaller household formation requiring more units and other things, but what really matters is the argument that we’re not building enough housing to meet the demand.

[^2]: Though it is in some areas due to increased housing consumption by households

I’ve always found the supply/demand curve visually a little baffling, so here’s a simple example to illustrate the effect of the supply/demand curve. There’s a town with two families, and two houses. Both families are housed, but neither can move without displacing the other. Additionally, no one can move to this town. If you destroy one of the houses, now either one of the families is homeless, or the two families are overcrowded. If you add a third house instead of demolishing one of them, now the households can move between houses if their family situation changes - they have a kid or a family member moves in and they need a bigger house, or a family member dies or moves out and they want a smaller house - or a new family can move to town. And if you build a fourth house, now there’s enough supply that the households can haggle with the owners of the empty houses for cheaper rents or purchase prices.

Obviously this is a massive oversimplification of housing markets, but anyone who has been in a line up to rent an apartment knows that shortages cause price spikes and overcrowding, and people who lives in cities during April 2020 when people moved out of downtowns know large amounts of vacant apartments cause price drops for rents.

The argument then goes on to state that the reason for the supply shortage is, in part, due to process, fees, and consultation. In a capitalist society, housing developers need to be able to rent or sell properties at a certain price - in the private sector, maybe 15% above expected costs - in order to get the loans necessary to buy the land, pay the fees, and pay for parts and labour. If an increase in government fees, long delays in the permitting process (remember, developers are potentially paying mortgages and interest while going through the permitting process) and uncertainty on the approvals (a neighbourhood group demanding an 8 unit apartment have 4 apartments instead), the costs of developing the building are lower than the potential sale price of the building, and it's unlikely to be built. I say unlikely because sometimes the developer will estimate wrong, build the building anyway, and be forced to take a loss or a lower profit. The argument would then state that uncertainty of profit discourages people from developing their own homes or entering the market, meaning small and mid sized developers are frozen out, and large developers move slowly and cautiously. A company like Great Gulf, who build massive apartment towers, can afford to take a few losses here and there because they hedge their bets, but John with a Truck who wants to build a 4plex needs to know he’s going to turn a profit, or he goes bankrupt.

The socialist rebuttal to this is multifaceted. They might claim that publicly built housing is naturally going to be more affordable than privately built housing, because public builders don’t need the 15% profit margins, can finance with better rates due to government borrowing advantage, and can amortize the debts over longer periods. They might claim that fees on building - what we in Ontario call development charges, but are also called impact charges, housing charges, and other phrases - don’t raise the price of the building, but in fact lower the price of the land. The argument is that the land market is competitive, and high fees redound to the advantage of builders, who have more sophisticated estimates, more choice of where to build, and no carrying costs until they buy some land. There’s also arguments about financialization or speculation, where people who have no intention of building any apartments are participating in the real estate market, only wanting to hold onto some land and drive up the price, or get outsized returns from a small investment on the back of future renters.

One of the strongest arguments coming from socialists is that development is less a question of supply and demand than it is power and class. Without naming specific premiers who are under investigation by the RCMP, housing developers are massive donors to political parties, and pay for access and preferential legislation. Some of these developers are connected to the mob, some may run for fascist parties in Italy. Sure, some of these developers may be paying for an even playing field, rule of law based development, and the eventual low prices these changes will bring, but you don’t become the richest people in Ontario building simple commodities in competitive markets. And it’s not like any housing developers are innovators - they’re just building balloon frame houses with stick lumber and drywall, which North America has known how to build for 100 odd years, or concrete towers, which we’ve known how to build for 70 years. North American development is, partly, a cash for access game, where big landowners get rezonings and approvals and make much more than the 15% profit that’s necessary to secure a bank loan. They then launder these profits through donations to hospitals, museums, and other cultural institutions to preserve their image, and then donate other portions to think tanks and newspapers to support the political parties who will keep granting them these favourable rezonings.

So who is correct? They both are. And that’s not saying that the truth is somewhere in the middle - there’s no middle. Both sides are correct - the capitalists are correct in saying bad policies are creating a supply deficit, and that supply deficit is hurting renters and first time buyers. And the socialists are correct in saying horrible actors are exploiting those bad policies and supply deficit to extract enormous rents and profits, and that public housing is the way to create deeply affordable housing.

I think that’s what my read of the data says, anyway.

## What is the data supporting these theories?

That’s a little more difficult to measure. The “housing crisis” as it’s broadly defined - increased rent and purchase prices for tenants and first time buyers, smaller apartments for new entrants, overcrowding in existing apartments, renovictions, increase in homelessness - is relatively new, with most cities becoming markedly less affordable shortly after the global financial crisis. Certain cities have been having huge housing affordability issues for multiple decades now - San Francisco, one of the least affordable cities in America, saw its housing prices start to increase in the 90s, and Vancouver’s started outpacing wages shortly thereafter. But these crises are also cyclical. San Francisco was the home of Henry George, the 19th century economist who was already advocating against the high cost of living in the peninsula.

The data supporting the “market urbanist” approach is scattered, and is pretty new. Any substantial reforms to zoning, processes, building codes, etc., is very recent. The arguments mainly point to data from 5 jurisdictions - Tokyo, Houston, Austin, Minneapolis, and New Zealand.

Tokyo is the example of housing abundance over a long period of time, and simplified zoning codes. Over a period of years, spurred on by the housing crisis in Tokyo in the early 90s, the federal government vastly simplified the zoning codes across the country, and in doing so effectively allowed small apartments in every district of the country, as well as increasing heights, lot coverage, and a number of other zoning and code changes. The net effect has been a wild amount of housing units built in the country, especially in the big cities. Japan has some of the flattest housing prices in the developed world, has the average housing size increasing substantially over twenty years as opposed to decreasing like much of the west, and also supports small businesses in doing so - Japan has about ten times the architects per capita as the US, many of them building small apartments and homes. But Japan is a weird outlier - its national population peaked about fifteen years ago after decades of very slow growth, and has been falling since. Tokyo itself is growing, but the demand curve is different than other western countries, which are growing, and in Canada’s case, quickly.

Houston is the example of no zoning, which is something market urbanists like Nolan Grey push for. As most of North America was adopting zoning codes to regulate neighbourhood development, the city of Houston demurred, having a series of consultations and referendums but never adopting a zoning code, opting instead for legal covenants in neighborhoods. Given neighbourhoods would vote to adopt certain restrictions on their land use, most of which was about average lot size in a neighbourhood, and a series of design related requirements on buildings that could be built on those lots. The result of this strange mix of regulations is that it’s pretty easy to build tall, skinny detached townhouses, which has resulted in a ton of detached townhouses in the inner suburbs of Houston, with relatively low prices for new, fairly luxurious housing, and some of the lowest housing prices to income ratios in the country. Houston also has a low homelessness ratio, despite being in a state with  threadbare welfare programs. In a cheap city, the argument goes, getting someone into a housing unit doesn't cost very much.

Austin, Minneapolis, and New Zealand (mostly Auckland) are all examples of new YIMBY actions. All three have loosened regulations on new developments, and the net effect has been increased supply, and flat lining or falling rents over a period of years where neighbouring jurisdictions have seen massive rent spikes.

The problem with the data is that there aren't enough jurisdictions who have taken a big swing with YIMBY policies over a long enough time period to see big results. In a statistics class you'd want to see 100 or so subject cities before you make any big claims, because local factors could have a much bigger influence on the results than something like zoning laws. YIMBYs have 5 jurisdictions that they can really point to, and that means their argument doesn’t have the robust, statistically significant effect that they (we) would like. But to the best of my knowledge, there are no jurisdictions that have made a big, meaningful process and zoning change, and ended up with more expensive housing as a result, so YIMBYism can’t be proven wrong by pointing to a negative.

Instead, people like Gord point to Stockholm and Vienna to explain the socialist argument, and lots of socialists also point to Singapore. Stockholm has pretty significant investment in social housing, Vienna is even higher, and Singapore is much higher still. Data in Stockholm and Vienna is pretty messy in a word-for-word comparison - both these countries have a lot of “cooperative” housing, but European cooperatives are much different than Canadian cooperatives, the European ones being a unique form of market housing with rules and levels of affordability that vary by jurisdiction, while Canadian cooperatives are (mostly) deeply affordable publicly subsidized housing that’s run by the tenants rather than the government. Singapore goes further than the two European examples, with essentially all of the housing being built and managed by the government, with tenants owning 99 year leases on their apartments.

It’s pretty clear that residents in these cities pay less of their income than urban Canadians for what are broadly considered nicer apartments - at least, larger than our new housing units and in nicer condition than our old housing units. Canada’s massive suburban population with very large, mostly detached housing is tough to compare to areas where land is more scarce. That’s not nothing - having bigger, nicer apartments that cost less money and are more secure for their tenants is the whole ballgame. But what’s also clear is that there are big issues with Vienna, Stockholm, and Singapore. If Japan can’t be used as an argument in favour of capitalist housing production because their population has been stagnant for 30 years, Vienna still hasn’t recovered its pre WW1 population! Stockholm is growing much faster, but that’s placed enormous demands on the public housing, with wait lists growing averaging 10 years, with some residents waiting for [20 years](https://bostad.stockholm.se/english/how-long-does-it-take/#:~:text=How%20long%20you%20have%20to,8%20to%2012%2C7%20years.). And Singapore is having many other issues - some of the 99 year leases are coming close to completion, which raises questions about what happens afterwards. Some incumbents are demanding the government build less housing, so the value of their leases goes up, which is…well, it’s instructive about Singaporian belief on supply and demand. And that’s not to mention the racial politics governing Singaporian housing allocation, which almost certainly would fall afoul of Canadian human rights laws.

There could be a “no true Scotsman” argument about how these aren’t socialist housing markets - Sweden is mostly a social democratic country, Austria is a conservative country with a social democratic city, and Singapore is an autocratic country with a nationalized housing board. But there’s a lot of people to house, and who knows when the revolution will come? So they’re probably the best examples.

## What does Gord get right?
On the recency of the housing crisis, Gord is mainly correct. Toronto’s year over year returns in the early 2000s were frequently in the low single digits, [around 3-4% per year](https://themeasureofaplan.com/canadian-housing-affordability/), usually around or only slightly above GDP growth in the country at that time, which was hovering at around 2-3%. However, Vancouver’s was significantly higher, often 8-9% YoY returns in the early 00s, and housing returns are cumulative - house prices increasing by a percent or two above incomes every year quickly divorces housing costs from household incomes due to compounding interest. Added to that, increasing house prices can be seen as a leading indicator of a supply shortage - a vacancy rate slipping from 7% to 6% will be barely noticeable by tenants and purchasers, as there’s still a relatively large stock of available housing, the available stock only having decreased by 14%. but a rate slipping from 3% to 2% is a decrease of 33%, and the rate slipping from 2% to 1% is a decrease of 50%. For reference, Toronto’s current vacancy rate for purpose built apartments is 1.7%. Considering part of the argument is that the process delays housing, these leading indicators are really important. But his general claim, that housing went a little silly in 2010 and beyond (really accelerating in ~2016, and then again during the pandemic) is broadly true.

About the reach of these problems, again Gord is mostly correct. [ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/how-europes-housing-scarcity-varies-across-countries/) finds the housing crisis expressed in different ways across Europe, with various countries having more crowing, longer stays in the parental homes, more people per bedroom, and house to income ratios. However, the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/dca3f034-bfe8-4f21-bcdc-2b274053f0b5) points out that the crisis is worse in the Anglosphere than in the rest of the developed world, which leads one to believe that might have something to do with Anglo approaches to planning and property rights . Of note is that Ireland is among the worst cases in the FT analysis, but comes out massively ahead in the ING analysis. That’s maybe a result of the time series - Ireland had an extremely deep crisis following the 2008 recession/Euro crisis, so the starting point matters for the analysis, and also probably has something to do with difficulty comparing Irish data due to its status as a tax haven for American capital.

About this being a result of income inequality, and speculation on land as opposed to investment in productive capacity, there’s probably something to this. There’s definitely a lot of land and real estate speculation on the market at any time. Left wing critics of this type of financial activity view it as a zero-sum activity, with end users ultimately paying the price for the inflated asset values, while right wing supporters of this view it as important for price discovery. I tend towards the left-wing criticism, but I’ll note that the thrust of the argument from small developers is “please make it easier for us to invest in productive capacity like building apartments”, and that it’s much easier to speculate on scarce assets - whether that’s developable land or apartments themselves - than on abundant assets.

And on general inequality, it’s important to note that the much less egalitarian United States has more affordable housing than Canada, and that the worst housing crisis is in some of the most egalitarian areas - BC and Ontario are more egalitarian than Saskatchewan, which has more affordable housing, but all of them fall massively behind Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, and other southern and sunbelt states with threadbare welfare states. A huge part of the inequality is because of the housing problem. Below are maps of housing prices versus incomes in Canada and the United States, as well as the GINI coefficients of the provinces and states, which is a coefficient which measures inequality. There's no observable correlation, and if anything, the less equal places have better housing affordability than the more equal places, which directly refutes Councillor Perks' argument.

![Canadian Housing Prices versus incomes](https://github.com/ammacmahon/ammacmahon.github.io/blob/main/assets/Canada.jpg?raw=true)

![Inequality in Canada vs United States](https://github.com/ammacmahon/ammacmahon.github.io/blob/main/assets/Inequality.jpg?raw=true)


About social housing being the solution, I think Gord is directionally correct. Deeply affordable housing is almost never provided by the private sector, except in forms like tenements, favelas, and other substandard housing. Publicly subsidized housing is a form of redistribution and a key element of the welfare state for those who are nowhere near being able to afford market rate housing. However, there’s a kind of conflation in terms going on here. Gord claims that no one has ever solved housing affordability through the private market. If we take that to mean deeply affordable housing for the lowest income in society, Gord is correct - that is almost always provided by government, or heavily subsidized by government. However, if we take housing affordability as a metric of median incomes versus median house prices, that is almost always addressed through the private market. Even one of his examples - Stockholm - has a robust private market, with 80% of Swedes in some form of private housing (whether that’s purely private, cooperative, union owned, or non profit), while 20% live in public housing. Canada used to have more publicly built and subsidized housing, but it also used to build more private housing, and the ratio of public housing never exceeded 10% of the total stock.

## Where do I think he could improve his analysis?
On Democracy and Zoning - this is where I butt heads with Gord the most. He talks about. A reminder (which you probably need, because I can’t shut up about this and this article is now thousands of words long), Gord’ claim is that:

> The argument that zoning by-laws, fees and fines, and a"robust" public consultation process are barriers to housing is "utterly, utterly false." The implication - and to be clear, I don’t think this is something that Councillor Perks believes - is that there is no trade-off between local democracy/regulation/zoning and economic efficiency.

Of course there is. I’m going to tackle zoning by-laws, fees, and fines first. There has to be a tradeoff between the legislation in our bylaws and what gets produced by the market. This is one of the first lessons learned in economics or sociology or essentially any type of science or social science. Delaying a building has the effect of the building being built later. Making the building shorter has the effect of the building not being as tall. That means, probably, either fewer units or fewer bedrooms. Making a building expensive to build for whatever reason - heritage protections, material choices, constant cutaways into the building's shape - absolutely makes it more expensive to rent or buy in.

To illustrate this, I guess I’ll use an example that Councillor Perks will probably hate. In the 2016 Democratic Party primaries, Senator Clinton attacked Senator Sanders by saying “Bernie promises everyone a pony”. She was referring, I think, to his proposal for Medicare for All, a state run universal health care system.

That was a dumb attack on the merits, because universal health care is pretty popular and functional in most western democracies except the United States. But universal health care does come with trade-offs - rich people don’t have preferential access to medicine, doctors  make less money, insurance claims adjusters and administrators will lose their jobs. Large numbers of American union members are concerned about Medicare for All plans, because generally union members get healthcare plans that are much better than what the government currently provides with Medicare/Medicaid, and would likely provide with a universal system. I would still loudly support Medicare for All, as I think the benefits vastly outweigh the costs. These universal health care systems exist across the world and are usually quite functional and popular. But if Bernie was saying that every resident of the United States could live in Windsor Castle, that would have been an “everyone deserves a pony” moment. Real estate development has very clear material and geographic/geometric tradeoffs. Windsor Castle is big and expensive! Building enough Windsor Castles for 300 million - or 8 billion, or whatever - people to live in would take a lot of resources and be a dumb promise. So working backwards from that, we can see that regulations on building shape and size, on process, on materials, on unit counts, on greenspace, on whatever else, have at least marginal tradeoffs.

This is, I think, something that many members of Toronto City Planning believe, and absolutely is believed by the housing secretariat, the city’s affordable housing coordinator, and by CreateTO, the city’s housing developer. Both of the latter divisions talk about accelerating public consultation, and have delivered reports to council on waiving fees, accelerating approvals, and in the case of deeply affordable housing, getting the provincial minister of housing to overrule the city’s zoning. It is listed in public reports that it’s essential to delivering housing affordably, and Councillor Perks votes for these staff recommendations. Retired Toronto City Planner Jennifer Keesmaat has been publicly criticizing restrictive zoning since the second she entered the private sector and tried to deliver affordable housing, as does former Senior Planner in the Chief Planner’s office Graig Uens, who recently had to defend a small development in University Rosedale through multiple rounds of committee hearings and appeals. Even the famously tight lipped former chief planner Gregg Lintern will subtly tweet about the necessity of as-of-right entitlements, gentle density, and expanding housing options.

On democracy, that’s a whole other kettle of fish. It’s tough to attack the idea that our society should be democratic. Democracy is pretty great! But it’s not clear to me that the city’s zoning bylaws, consultation practices, and housing production is in any way meaningfully democratic, or that attempts to increase the importance of these processes make the city more democratic.

To investigate this, I have two thoughts: one, that our processes are actually anti-democratic, and secondly, that our processes aren’t democracy as its normally considered, but instead formalized corruption.

On the first, that our processes are anti-democratic - well, I think this is pretty obvious when investigated. In survey after survey, “building more housing” is a popular stance, and “building more affordable housing” is much more popular. Political polling has its issues, and if you word questions about building affordable housing near the respondent it polls underwater, but politicians run on building housing, because people like having roofs over their heads and construction jobs pay well. Exceptionally few candidates run on “building less housing”, but then when they get into office, politicians do just that - create barriers to market housing, defund affordable housing, and create processes that delay and deny. So this is anti-democratic.

But it’s not just that. Democracy, in most people’s conceptualization, is a modernist practice. It’s about counting votes, and the most votes win. There are deep conceptualizations of democracy, where activism and organizing are more important than sheer votes, and consensus democracy, but in the popular imagination it's a majoritarian practice. But our “robust consultation processes” are anything but majoritarian. They’re whiter and richer than society as a whole, and are made up almost exclusively of incumbent property owners. And unlike voting, they’re not a measured and observable process - advocates for a particular decision, like the recent Villiers Island proposal in Toronto-Danforth where advocates asked for more density and housing in the plan, can massively outweigh the detractors of a plan (or supporters of a plan deemed insufficient), but despite writing more letters, having more people speak on an item, and out organizing their opponents, they lose.

And finally, democracy is not a legalistic practice, but that’s very much what our housing proposals are. I’m trying to avoid using too much planning jargon - it’s alienating and annoying - but I’ll get into it a bit here. If someone wants to build, say, a 4 unit apartment in Toronto, they need approvals. Technically, 4 plexes are allowed city wide due to the Expanding Housing Options in Neighbourhoods policies passed a couple years ago. However, those policies restrict the height, depth, and width of a given building that make it almost impossible to build “as-of-right”, by which I mean going to the building department with an application and getting a permit in short order. Instead, you need a planning process before you can get a building permit. For a small proposal, most of this will go through the Committee of Adjustment, an adjudicative board made up of “subject matter experts”, appointed by City Council. The developer will seek “variances”, which are alterations to the existing bylaw that the applicant wishes to have deemed minor and acceptable by the board. There are tests for this under the planning act, but again, this is all a bit more wishy-washy than one would hope - an example might be that the zoning bylaw says that the building can only be 12 metres tall, but to fit 4 stories and build 4 units, the applicant needs to build something that’s 13 or so metres tall. Is that minor? You would think so, but not always.

But the adjudicators don’t make the decision in a vacuum. City planning will opt whether or not to write into the committee - of note, they will never write in support of a variance, only in opposition. City Councillors can also write in with their opinion - as the committee is supposed to be arms-length and is appointed by city council, some view it as inappropriate, but others are happy to write in. And neighbours can write in support or opposition, though importantly, Committee members are meant to take into account the geographic proximity of the people writing in. If you would like to move into a neighbourhood and that would be facilitated in part due to a theoretical development, your opinion is judged as lesser than your prospective neighbour who already lives there. So then the decision goes ahead.

But that’s not the end. These decisions can be taken to the Toronto Local Appeals Body (TLAB), which was an appeals adjudicative board constituted because the provincial Local Planning Appeals Tribunal/Ontario Municipal Board/Ontario Land Tribunal was so clogged with appeals and fights. And the TLAB decision is, technically, not the end - opponents can appeal to the courts if they decide that there was an error in law, potentially snaring up a development at 3 different levels of justice, with lawyers and planners and experts the whole way, and extremely little in the way of what’s usually considered democracy.

But there’s another question about democracy in the development process - what is local democracy? Well, I could say that corruption is a form of local democracy. That sounds provocative, and it’s meant to! But I think it’s also true. Because democracy is a discretionary process. The idea of democracy is that there is a set of rules, and then people get to influence decisions within that ruleset. They’ll influence it through neighbourhood groups, political parties, activist organizations, and, yes, lobbies. Local democracy, especially in cities the size of Toronto, used to be based around machine politics, where political parties and actors would reward supporters with jobs and graft and goodies. This world embraced corruption as a form of local politics. That kind of literal brown envelope democracy has been formally erased, but there are still obvious examples of graft that pop up now and again, and lots of soft graft, where things are not necessarily illegal, but definitely untoward. And corruption, or cash for access, is high proof lobbying. The everclear of lobbying.

I know this is provocative, so I want to give an example. Let’s say you have a development in a “sensitive neighbourhood”. A local neighbourhood organization opposes it. When that neighbourhood organization calls and emails and asks for meetings with a city councillor about the development, their leverage in those conversations is that they will vote, donate, and organize against the councillor in their reelection if the development goes the developers way. When the developers calls and emails and asks for meetings with a city councillor, they’re also saying they will donate and organize against the councillor (they probably don’t live in the riding) if it the proposal doesn’t go their way, but also, maybe the councillor’s son or husband or chief of staff will get a nice job if it does go their way. I think it’s a morally despicable form of local democracy, but when you introduce a level of discretion into a process, the input that people get is relative to their power - economic, racial, gender, class, etc - and so a developer wielding that power is a version of democracy.

Our local experts, affordable housing providers, and City Council decisions state that our existing processes, fees, and prices are a barrier to housing production, and a small number of unrepresentative actors use legal methods to abuse those processes to further slow housing production, all in the name of democracy.

## What is to be done?
Look, there’s about a hundred good books and articles out there about what generally needs to happen to build better cities, and most of their suggestions would be enormous improvements. [Arbitrary Lines](https://islandpress.org/books/arbitrary-lines#desc), [Fixer Upper](https://www.brookings.edu/books/fixer-upper/), [Our Crumbling Foundations](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/736870/our-crumbling-foundation-by-gregor-craigie/9781039009387), [Home Truths](https://www.ubcpress.ca/home-truths), [The Affordable City](https://islandpress.org/books/affordable-city#desc). There would need to be Ontario specific changes due to our laws and systems, but those are minor adjustments. It boils down to a need for subsidized housing and procedural reform.

Councillor Perks and the rest of the progressive movement are absolutely correct when they talk about the need for greater public provision of affordable housing. The fact of the matter is that housing is so unaffordable for so many people now that if the market can correct for it, it will take a generation or more before low income people can afford a decent place in a market rate unit, and those people need assistance immediately. Public funding of attainable and deeply affordable housing is necessary.

But as was said in an earlier part of this essay, our processes and zoning need to be cleaned up. What’s key to understand here is that the City, if it chooses to build affordable apartments, isn’t some magical beast that doesn’t have to obey zoning laws and other planning regulations. The City of Toronto is, under Ontario law, basically a corporation, and that corporation's development requests are bound by all applicable provincial planning frameworks as well as the local bylaws. If anything, it’s more bound by them, because the City’s development corporation can’t take City Planning to an appeals body if it makes a decision that the public development corporation doesn’t like, and that means the conservative impulse in City Planning has much more leverage than in an application with a private developer. The public corporation has to obey the laws to the letter, while most development that happens in Toronto is the case of the city saying “you can’t build anything here”, the applicant asking to build the Burj Khalifa, and the result being somewhere in the middle after an extremely long, quasi legal process.

An example of this problem is when the city decided to build some deeply affordable apartments in Davenport, East York, and Willowdale. Planning didn’t object to the proposal, despite it not conforming with the laws, but planning staff flagged to council that the process to allow this subsidized housing could take years. The city needed to write to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and request what’s known as a “Ministerial Zoning Order”, which overrules the city’s planning laws. So there was a situation where the city was trying to build something that it said shouldn’t be allowed, and rather than reform the laws, asked a higher order of government to overrule itself. And because one of them was in a constituency that was important to the provincial government, it took years of additional process to get built, and costs exorbitantly more than the others which didn’t have to go through a process.

Similarly, the city can’t pick certain bodies - like non-profits, land trusts, cooperatives - and deem them as immune from planning rules. We see this problem of process again when the city decided to permit buildings with between 2-4 units city wide. They did that, it was great, but they also introduced a series of regulations which makes them financially unfeasible to build in almost all cases in the current market. Not affordable apartments, which would require subsidy - I’m talking market rate apartments, sometimes impossible to build profitably even if the land is free. A city whose Official Plan says that 4 storey buildings are generally considered city wide, and recently passed a much ballyhooed plan to legalize 4 unit apartment buildings, also passed a height overlay map where the tallest buildings can be without a planning process is 12 metres. The problem? Well, a storey is usually at least 3.2 metres, if not more, meaning it’s pretty near impossible to build a 4 story apartment without the building being 13 or more metres. Take an organization like Circle Land Trust, a great organization that inherited a bunch of Toronto Community Housing’s single family homes. They’re holding somewhere in the range of 600 buildings, many with 1 unit. They could quadruple their offerings under the Expanding Housing Options in Neighbourhoods reforms, but to do so, they’d need to go through a planning process on every single application, and they don’t have the organizational capacity or the money to do so.

What’s infuriating is the places that Councillor Perks points at - Vienna, Stockholm - recognize this. The zoning in these cities is massively more permissive than in Toronto, and is often less consultative. Rather than consulting on every individual project, politicians run on platforms about how housing should be constructed, and the city does much larger consultations on the vision document for the city. The City of Toronto has zoning bylaws specific to small neighbourhoods that no one was ever consulted on, and pre-dates every councillor currently serving by 4 decades, and they bind massive amounts of our land to the past. And Vienna has poured huge resources into speeding up permitting, with the Social Democratic government recognizing that time is money, and spending time debating the shape and size of housing creates longer waitlists and more immiseration. And closer to home, so does the biggest social democratic government in North America - BC’s NDP government passed massive housing reforms, recognizing that slow processes and bad faith actors were contributing to their housing crisis.

Process and subsidy are inextricably linked. The city is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on every affordable house we try and build, because our own system does not want us to build affordable housing. We have a machine gun aimed at our foot and the trigger is pulled, and we can’t figure out why our feet hurt, and the sooner our progressive politicians recognize that, the sooner we can fix it.
