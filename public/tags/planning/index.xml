      <title>Pretextual Planning</title>

      <description>Sean Galbraith and Strong Towns have both talked about pretextual planning. Pretextual planning is fairly self explanatory - a city (or other level of government, or maybe a private business or NGO) creates a plan, and elements of that plan are a pretext for doing something else.
The strong towns argument brings up parking requirements, which are a horrible policy idea that forces developers to build expensive parking, despite small and midsized cities having a massive parking surplus, and large cities trying to redevelop parking into higher order uses like housing, public amenities, and employment sites.</description>
