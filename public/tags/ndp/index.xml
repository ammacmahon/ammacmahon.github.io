      <description>I’ve been reading some posts by David Moscrop, who I greatly admire, as well as Edward Row, who I also really like, discussing who exactly is left and right in Canadian electoral politics.
David argues that the Liberal Party of Canada can’t be meaningfully seen as left-wing, with his examples forcing railroad workers to arbitration and demanding public servants go back to work. Edward argued that the NDP can’t be seen as a left-wing or socialist party, because in 2013 they removed the word socialism from their constitution.</description>
